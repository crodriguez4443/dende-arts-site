<p>For someone starting a martial art, it might not be clear how much practice is required to achieve their goals. Amateurs and people training as a hobby will train differently from others looking to compete. Here is a rough guide to how much practice you will need, depending on your goals.</p>
<p><strong>For amateurs who practice martial arts as a hobby, you should practice at least 2-3 times a week. For people looking to learn their martial art in depth (maybe looking to teaching), you should start training about 3 times a week and work your way up to 4 or 5 times a week. Practice sessions should be at least 20 minutes, but can go for much longer. 80% of this training should mostly be specific to the martial art you are doing. The last 20% includes mobility work, conditioning, and other ancillary activities. Martial artists looking to compete should practice 5-6 times a week and may need to workout multiple time a day. These training will likely include some form of strength and conditioning, along with competition specific practice.</strong></p>
<h2>Start slow and ramp up as you go</h2>

<p><strong>One of the biggest misconceptions is that you need to train 6 hours a day every single day.</strong> This is NOT true for beginners! Everyone who starts training martial arts should start slow. Start with two to three classes per week spread out across the week. Over the course of a few weeks or months, you can increase that amount to 4 or even 6 times a week.</p>
