<p>Mestre Bimba, the creator of Capoeira Regional, used a system of progressing at his academy with his famous “lenços” or scarves. <br>These scarves were given to students to show their competence in several aspects of Capoeira. <br>The scarves were made of silk. <br>This paid paid homage to the old days when capoeiristas would use these scarves to protect themselves against knife attacks. <br>There were four lenços: white, blue, red, and yellow, each one representing a new advancement by the student in their capoeira training.</td>

<p>After the basics course, created by Mestre Bimba, a student was awarded the blue lenço and a medallion. <br>The blue lenço was given to students after about 6 months to a year of training. <br>Receiving your blue lenço meant performing all eight basic sequences and playing a game where you would demonstrate the balões. <br>Below is an example of the balões. <br>Students who reached this level were known as “graduados” or advanced students.</td>

<td>### <strong>The Red Lenço</strong></p>
<p>The red scarf was for those who wanted to deepen their knowledge of the fight elements of Capoeira. <br>It was optional to sign up for this course, which required perfecting basic movements, sweeps, throws, and damage dealing blows (traumatizantes). <br>Students were taught how to defend themselves on the streets vs multiple opponents. <br>This multiple attacker training was called “Bumba meu Boi”. <br>The last part of the training was the “emboscada”. <br>The embuscada challenged a student’s ability to ward off multiple surprise attacks as they made their way through from one point to another. <br>Emboscadas were often held in the jungle, meaning your opponents could pop up from any direction as you made your way. <br>This exercise caught the interest of the military, who used it as a part of their training program.</td>

<p>After receiving the red lenço, students could take a second specialization course, where they would receive a yellow lenço. <br>In this course, participants were taught to defend themselves against knife and gun attacks. <br>Students would learn how to handle a switchblade, a knife, and how to disarm opponents with these weapons. <br>Knives in particular were very common during the 1930's,40s, so it makes sense why this was included.</td>

<td>### <strong>The White Lenço</strong></p>
<p>A common misconception was that the white lenço was the “mestre” lenço. <br>Meaning that once you received this lenço you were given the title of mestre. <br>This is not true, however the title of “mestre charangueiro” is used and could be the cause of this confusion. <br>The white lenço was a recognition of a Capoeirista’s ability with music, which included the berimbau, pandeiro, and singing. <br>These were the only instruments used in the roda of Mestre Bimba.</p>
<p>If you look at a modern Capoeira video, you’ll notice that scarves are not being used. <br>Instead of scarves, people use chords made of yarn. <br>These chords came after Mestre Bimba created his lenços and is often attributed to being rooted in Grupo Senzala. <br>Grupo Senzala is one of the oldest Capoeira schools that grew to a global scale. <br>Their graduation system is one of the oldest and helped lay the foundation for what you see used today.</td>

<td>### <strong>There was no lenço to become mestre</strong></p>
<p>According to Mestre Nenel, Mestre Bimba believe that the rank of mestre was something bestowed by the Capoeira community. <br>This was not a title that could have been given with a lenço, belt or anything else. <br>Mestre Bimba never graduated anyone to mestre during his lifetime. <br>However, before leaving to Goiânia, Mestre bimba left a handful of blank certifications with Mestre Decânia (a student of his). <br>These certifications were meant to recognize the name placed on them as a Mestre. <br>Mestre Bimba even signed these documents so that they would be seen as legitimate once used. <br>They were used, and to this day, the following people were awarded the title of mestre with these certifications. <br>Mestres Itapoan, Luizinho, Acordeon, Camisa Roxa, Fauzi Abdala, and Decânio.</td>

<td>## Modern Chord Progression</p>
<h3><strong><h3 id="aluno-student-6-12-months-experience"><h3 id="aluno-student-6-12-months-experience">Aluno - Student (6-12 months experience)</h3></h3></strong></h3>
<p>Aluno means student in Portuguese. <br>The number of student belts differs amongst groups, however the aluno will be expected to know more and more with each chord they unlock. <br>Chords are a sign of your hard work and are given during a troca de cordeõs (changing of the chords) . <br>The event is usually done once a year and is hosted by your school or the headquarters in your area.</p>
<p>The very first chord usually takes six months to a year to receive and is unique because Capoeiristas refer to this event as the batizado. <br>Your batizado is your introduction into the world of Capoeira. <br>It’s a symbolic transition to being a capoeirista and starting on the path to one day becoming a mestre.</td>

<p>The aluno’s main responsibility is to train the lessons that their teacher shows them. <br>Students are always encouraged to ask their teachers how to do certain moves, what things mean in Capoeira, and how to continue improving. <br>In the beginning, it might seem overwhelming, but you learn Capoeira with persistence and patience. <br>One hack to getting better faster is to keep some close Capoeira friends that you can hang out with and train with at the park or over someone’s house.</td>

<td>### <strong>Graduado/Monitor - Advanced Student (5-7 years of experience)</strong></p>
<p>Many groups have a chord that represent an advanced student who is an example to the beginners. <br>After about 5-7 years of training, this student may graduate to monitor/graduado. <br>These are titles for an advanced students, although not all schools use these names. <br>These chords are also given at the troca de cordoes.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of an advanced student varies depending on the student and the teacher. <br>The graduado/monitor may be asked to run the warm ups, provide demonstrations of movements during class, or teach some classes. <br>Many people consider this as the stage where a student begins to develop a level of independence and ability to teach. <br>This means being able to play all the instruments, as well as playing good Capoeira, and teaching. <br>Teachers hold a lot of responsibility, so the advanced students likewise will carry a part of that responsibility.</p>
<p>At this level newer students will confide, trust, and look up to you. <br>Make sure you’re an example to new students like a big brother or sister. <br>Train harder than before and welcome new responsibilities, because new students will benefit from the work ethic you show.</td>

<td>### <strong>Instructor/Professor - Instructor / Professor (8-12 years of experience)</strong></p>
<p>All schools have a teacher rank and lies somewhere at the half-way point of a Capoeiristas journey to mestre. <br>After about 8-12 years, most people reach the rank of Instructor and beyond that professor. <br>Instructor is a widely used title name, but other names that are used for this or similar ranks include formado among others.</p>
<p>Receiving this chord is a big deal and a sign that you’re ready to start teachers others the art of Capoeira. <br>But keep your ego in check because instructores and professores must continue learning and develop their craft. <br>This is why even though you might start teaching, it’s more important than ever to stay close to your mestre and continue learning from them. <br>Once you receive this rank and start teaching you’ll likely have more questions that you thought possible. <br>Keep you teacher close and learn from them all the little things about Capoeira that you forgot to ask about when you were a student.</td>
