Song as sung by DJ Capoeira at the Praça da Republica
</figcaption>
<p>Bamba - refers to a tough buy. or the very best players in this case. The song is calling for you to show your very best.</p>
<p>Note, there are MANY improvisations in this translation. the singer in this case references many capoeiristas and locations that are specific to them. Feel free to include do the same and mention places or people that have to do with you. Keeping with the theme of the song, they should be Bambas.</p>
