        <td>## Helanca The Fabric of Choice<br><br>Capoeira uniforms, specifically the pants, are made of Helanca. Helanca is the type of fabric commonly used in Brazil to produce clothing. Helanca is a patented yarn made of polyamide filaments. Polyamides are a group of synthetic polymers (synthetic fibers) and are widely recognized for their strength and elasticity. Think Nylon, Polyester, or Rayon. Helanca requires a special manufacturing process. This process was first developed in 1931 by Rudolph H. Kägi. After its original development, the [Swiss company Heberlein & Co acquired the rights and patent to Kägi's process](https://www.heberlein.com/en/history/). Helanca has been produced in Switzerland since 1936 and today is a popular fabric in Brazil.</td>

        <td>1n 1955, [Time magazine released a story](https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,893170,00.html) that explains how Helanca became so popular in Brazil. The article explains how Helanca was first produced by a swizz company by accident. Instead of creating a substitute for wool, "ersatz wool", they created a nylon that could stretch. Stretch nylon became incredibly popular. So popular, that the United States and others began producing their own version. In 1955 various licensing disputes were resolved between the competitors. Helanca and "Helanca knock-offs" began to flood the market and meet demand. Although the article doesn't touch on Brazil, it is likely Brazilians call any synthetic stretch fabric, helanca. Why? Because it was the first on the market. Similar to Spanish speakers who call gum "chicle", because chiclets was the first gum on the market.</td>
