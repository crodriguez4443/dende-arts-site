<h1>How to Contribute</h1>
<p>Contributions are welcome! Thank you!</p>
<h2>General Guidelines</h2>
<p>Some quick notes when making a pull request.</p>
<ul>
<li>Match the style and formatting of the code you are editing.</li>
<li>Each pull request should be focused on a single thing (a single bug fix, a single feature, etc.). This makes reviewing easier and minimizes merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Include a description of the problem being solved and what your code does. Steps to reproduce the problem or example input/output are very helpful.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding Options</h2>
<p>Keeping the wizard as short as possible is a priority. Pull requests that add options to the wizard will probably not be accepted. Instead, you can add an advanced setting to <a href="https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown/blob/master/src/settings.js">settings.js</a>.</p>
<h2>Adding Frontmatter Fields</h2>
<p>Similarly, default frontmatter output is limited to just a few widely used fields to avoid bloat. However, you may add new optional frontmatter fields.</p>
<p>To do so, follow the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown/blob/master/src/frontmatter/example.js">/src/frontmatter/example.js</a>.</p>
<p>Users will be able to include your new frontmatter field by editing <code>frontmatter_fields</code> in <a href="https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown/blob/master/src/settings.js">settings.js</a>.</p>
