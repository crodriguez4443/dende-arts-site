<p>I mentioned earlier that floreios have their place in the game of Capoeira. At the same time, you can't have a Capeoria game of just flips. There are times when Capeoiristas will do flipping competitions, but  in the roda, you need to have a full understanding of the fundamentals before introducing acrobatics into your game. Sometimes, when the game is fast and exciting a flip of some kind makes sense.</p>
<p>That being said, it's beautiful to see some amazing capoeiristas fly around the roda in a way that looks easy. I thoroughly enjoy training these movements and hope you do too!</p>
<p>If you're just starting out with aerial floreios, then make sure to take care of your body when you do these movements. Many of these floreios can be dangerous, so make sure you are careful as you train and don't take these bits of advice as gospel. Make sure you practice in a place where you can be shown proper technique in a safe environment.</p>
