I tried on a variety of undergarments with them and you couldnâ€™t even make out the pattern through the pants fabric! I feel much better wearing these to an event knowing that everyone wonâ€™t be able to see right through the pants Iâ€™m wearing. Will definitely be purchasing more. Canâ€™t wait til there are brown pants for angoleiros! I bought a medium & were true to the recommended size chart. I am 5'2 for length reference.",

They are whatâ€™s in in fasion for gym-goers. These came in at a great time where the the wide-leg or straight leg abadas have once been the ONLY options in terms of choice in uniform!\n\nThe Abada Joggers are definitely a game changer and bravo Calado for the professional service in ordering a pair! Thank you for considering performance, style AND comfort to your fellow capoeiristas! Highest Recommendations!!",

No more running to the tailor with abadÃ¡s that flap in the wind around the ankles while being uncomfortably tight around the hips.\nThese fit great, both with and without corda. The fabric is comfy. POCKETS!!! Also, due to the jogger-like feel they are also easy to \"dress up\" for a batizado, or \"dress down\" for a casual training session or street roda.",
