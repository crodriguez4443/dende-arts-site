        "review_content": "I recently got a pair of abadás from Dendê Arts and I’m seriously impressed. The quality and fit are on another level compared to most capoeira pants I’ve trained in. You can tell real capoeiristas designed these... they move easily during ginga, kicks, and ground work without feeling restrictive. The tapered fit looks modern, and the material feels durable while still being super comfortable. If you’re tired of baggy, awkward abadás, Dendê Arts is definitely worth checking out. Highly recommend for anyone who wants performance AND style in their capoeira gear.",

I tried on a variety of undergarments with them and you couldn’t even make out the pattern through the pants fabric! I feel much better wearing these to an event knowing that everyone won’t be able to see right through the pants I’m wearing. Will definitely be purchasing more. Can’t wait til there are brown pants for angoleiros! I bought a medium & were true to the recommended size chart. I am 5'2 for length reference.",

They are what’s in in fasion for gym-goers. These came in at a great time where the the wide-leg or straight leg abadas have once been the ONLY options in terms of choice in uniform!\n\nThe Abada Joggers are definitely a game changer and bravo Calado for the professional service in ordering a pair! Thank you for considering performance, style AND comfort to your fellow capoeiristas! Highest Recommendations!!",

POCKETS!!! Also, due to the jogger-like feel they are also easy to \"dress up\" for a batizado, or \"dress down\" for a casual training session or street roda.",
