Sometimes people wonder if Capoeira has a religious or spiritual aspect to it and you most likely started asking this question because of a song you heard. Many Capoeira songs have Christian or Candomblé (an African religion) references. Not only that, but when you feel the music, the vibrations from the bateria (the band), and hear the clapping of everyone in the roda, you might feel like there is an energy that is taking hold. So you ask yourself! Does Capoeira have a religious or spiritual component?

Yes and No, Capoeira does not affiliate with any religion, but there is a spiritual aspect that has less to do with gods and more to do with how we the practitioners relate to one another. There are some practitioners who are themselves religious. Brazil is a very catholic country, however there is a clear line between anything religious and the practice of Capoeira.
