Marimbondo - Literally is a wasp, but stands to reason that it may be the name/apelido of a capoeirista.

Sinhá - "sinhá" is used as a form of address for a woman, similar to "miss" or "ma'am" in English. It is considered respectful and polite, but not as formal as "senhora" (which would be the equivalent of "madam"). It is commonly used when addressing a woman who is older or in a position of authority.
