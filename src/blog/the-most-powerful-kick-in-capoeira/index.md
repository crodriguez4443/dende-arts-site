        <td>Capoeira is an Afro Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance, acrobatics, and self defense. This is why it is so curious that a few high-level MMA fighters are choosing to learn the art, specifically one of its most powerful kicks**, Meia Lua de Compasso. If you've seen this kick before, it's very clear how dangerous this kick can be. The lightning fast speed, tricky angle, and unorthodox nature places it as one of the most, if not, the most powerful kick in Capoeira.**</td>

In case you have not seen, there is proof that this kick is effective in terms of its speed and knockout power. This video of MMA fighter Marcus Aurelias shows us how fast, tricky, and devastating the kick can be against an opponent. The opponent is KO'd with one kick to the jaw and the question is, can this be replicated? or is this a lucky shot?

## The Advantages to Meia Lua de Compasso

There seem to be three good reasons for using this kick that others have pointed out. The first is how tricky it can be to spot this kick. I've never seen it countered, even though most of these situations have been in [non-elite level fights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL-xl9zhNt0). The kick is not well understood, and very nontraditional. It's no wonder that people would not know how to counter itâ€¦ because nobody does it. **This trickery is the first advantage that Meia Lua has.**

  
**The second advantage is its speed.** The kick is undeniably fast what looks like a wild left hook with your legs. The movement uses the entire body to generate an incredible amount of energy that you unleash on your opponent. If you ever see the kick done in Capoeira rodas, the kick looks like a whip, zooming around. And at this speed it looks ferocious.

  
The last thing this kick has going for it, is that when you hit, you hit with a very small surface area. Ask yourself, would you rather get hit with a metal bar or a hammer of equal weight? Most people would say the metal bar. The surface area of the hammer is much smaller and the weight is at the very end. **The concentration of force guarantees a hard hit**. This differs from other kicks done with the shin, which is also extremely strong, but perhaps not as concentrated as a circular kick using the heel.  

## If it's so Good, then why doesn't Everyone use it?

But, if it were such a good kick, then everyone would be using it. Just because the kick has the ability to knock someone out, doesn't mean that fighters will use it. Fighters use techniques that have a proven and reliable ability to put down their opponent or at least provide them with some advantage. MMA fighters in this sense are perfect test subjects for understanding why one kick is "effective" and why others are not.  

## The Chapeu de Couro Kick

Lets take another Capoeira kick that has gained some notoriety for its raw strength. Chapeu de Couro is a kick performed from the ground and swings the users whole body at the opponent. The kick is incredibly effective at producing force, but as you can see, the set up is long, which makes the kick slow. Not only that, but there is a huge amount of technical coordination required to perform this kick. It's clear that for these reasons, chapeu de couro is not used in MMA. I can't think of a single instance in which this kick was used. And if mixed martial artists don't think that it's useful or even worth trying, then it's "power" is questionable.
