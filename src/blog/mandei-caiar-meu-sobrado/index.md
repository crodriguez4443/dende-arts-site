| Mandei caiar meu sobrado  
Mandei, mandei, mandei  
Mandei caiar de amarelo  
Caiei, caiei, caiei  
  
**Mandei caiar meu sobrado  
Mandei, mandei, mandei  
Mandei caiar de amarelo  
Caiei, caiei, caiei**  
  
Amarelo que lembra dourado  
Dourado, que é meu berimbau  
Dourado, de cordão de ouro  
Besouro, Besouro, Besouro  
  
**Mandei caiar meu sobrado  
Mandei, mandei, mandei  
Mandei caiar de amarelo  
Caiei, caiei, caiei**  
  
Pra quem nunca ouviu falar  
E pra aqueles que dizem: é lenda  
Pois saibam que Besouro Preto  
Viveu, viveu e morreu  
  
**Mandei caiar meu sobrado  
Mandei, mandei, mandei  
Mandei caiar de amarelo  
Caiei, caiei, caiei**  
  
Pras bandas de Maracangalha  
Sem temer a inimigo nenhum  
Não valeu, seu corpo fechado  
Pras facas de ticum  
  
**Mandei caiar meu sobrado  
Mandei, mandei, mandei  
Mandei caiar de amarelo  
Caiei, caiei, caiei**  
  
Mas mesmo depois de morto  
Entre uma e outra cantiga  
Besouro vai sempre viver  
Enquanto existir mandinga  
  
**Mandei caiar meu sobrado  
Mandei, mandei, mandei  
Mandei caiar de amarelo  
Caiei, caiei, caiei** | I had my house painted  
I did, I did, I did  
I had it painted yellow  
I painted, I painted, I painted  
  
I had my house painted  
I did, I did, I did  
I had it painted yellow  
I painted, I painted, I painted  
  
Yellow which is reminiscent of gold  
Golden, which is my berimbau  
Gold, from gold cord  
Besouro, Besouro, Besouro  
  
I had my house painted  
I did, I did, I did  
I had it painted yellow  
I painted, I painted, I painted  
  
For those who have never heard  
And for those who say: it's a legend  
Know that Besouro Preto  
Lived, lived, and died  
  
I had my house painted  
I did, I did, I did  
I had it painted yellow  
I painted, I painted, I painted  
  
Around Maracangalha  
Without fearing any enemy  
It didn't work, his closed body  
For ticum knives  
  
I had my house painted  
I did, I did, I did  
I had it painted yellow  
I painted, I painted, I painted  
  
But even after he died  
Between one and another song  
Besouro will always live  
As long as there is mandinga  
  
I had my house painted  
I did, I did, I did  
I had it painted yellow  
I painted, I painted, I painted |

Author: Unknown (Do you know who wrote this song? Tell us in the comments!)  
T/L: The chorus of this song is a bit awkward to translate white still trying to fit a song-structure, so I made adaptations for the above English lyrics. "Mandei" is "I ordered/hired people to do something", roughly. "Caiar" is actually "to whitewash" in English, in the sense of applying a solution (the composition may vary) to paint walls white.
