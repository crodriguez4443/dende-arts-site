### **How to Improve your singing**

If you want to improve your Capoeira singing, do the following. 

1\. Listen/read the song. 

2\. Memorize the song chunks at a time. 

3\. Work on the rhythm. Sing the choros again and again to get the rhythm down.

4\. Sing the verses. Be aware that a lot of words and sounds get swallowed up from singing fast or trying to fit a lot of words in a few beats. 

5\. Sing the song with a instrument you know to play or are learning to play. 

6\. Try it in the roda!

## 1\. Ô sim sim sim, Ô não não não
