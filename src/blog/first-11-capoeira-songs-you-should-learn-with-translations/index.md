In Capoeira, music is a huge deal! Knowing Capoeira songs is a big part of learning the art and for some people this can be intimidating. If you’re not sure what songs to start learning, below is a list of 11 songs that are great for beginners. These song work for beginners because they are relatively easy to learn and you often hear them sung in the roda. The songs and their translations are provided to give a little extra context for the song. 

### **How to Improve your singing**

If you want to improve your Capoeira singing, do the following. 

1\. Listen/read the song. 

2\. Memorize the song chunks at a time. 

3\. Work on the rhythm. Sing the choros again and again to get the rhythm down.

4\. Sing the verses. Be aware that a lot of words and sounds get swallowed up from singing fast or trying to fit a lot of words in a few beats. 

5\. Sing the song with a instrument you know to play or are learning to play. 

6\. Try it in the roda!

## 1\. Ô sim sim sim, Ô não não não

Paraná is a river on the frontier of Brazil and Paraguay. The song is about going to the war in Paraná where many Capoeiristas were sent to fight army of Paraguay. The Brazilian government though this would be a good way to get rid of many Capoeiristas, however the plan backfired when these soldier returned as heroes for decimating the army of Paraguay.

## 3\. A manteiga derramou (vou dizer a meu sinhô...)

| Portuguese | English |
| --- | --- |
| Vou dizer a meu sinhô  
Que a manteiga derramou  
  
E a manteiga não é minha  
E a manteiga é de ioiô  
  
**Vou dizer a meu sinhô  
Que a manteiga derramou**  
  
E a manteiga não é minha  
E a manteiga é de ioiô  
  
**Vou dizer a meu sinhô  
Que a manteiga derramou  
**  
A manteiga é de ioiô  
Caiu na água e se molhou  
  
**Vou dizer a meu sinhô  
Que a manteiga derramou  
**  
A manteiga é do patrão  
Caiu no chão e derramou  
  
**Vou dizer a meu sinhô  
Que a manteiga derramou  
**  
A manteiga não é minha  
É pra filha de ioiô | I’ll tell my master  
The butter has melted  
  
And butter is not mine  
And butter is of the master  
  
**I’ll tell my master  
The butter has melted**  
  
And butter is not mine  
And butter is of the master  
  
**I’ll tell my master  
The butter has melted**  
  
Butter is of the master  
Fell into the water and got wet  
  
**I’ll tell my master  
The butter has melted**  
  
The butter is of the boss  
Fell to the ground and poured  
  
**I’ll tell my master  
The butter has melted**  
  
The butter is not mine  
It’s for the child of the master |

Capoeira has its origins in the enslavement of Africans in Brazil. As a slave there is little recourse for getting back at your master. One way to annoy and make the life of your master difficult is to lie and say that there is no more butter because whatever reason you can think of. These small jabs is what the song sings about. This song is very very old. With many older Capoeira songs, we can assume that there was a direct link between the song and the topic it talks about. These songs are as much a part of the oral tradition of Africa as much as it is about Capoeira and the lives of the people associated with the art.

A simple song about presenting yourself. In many Capoeira CDs you'll notice that the artists take the time to talk to the audience and introduce themselves. Presenting yourself is a cultural norm from Brazil that can be seen in this song.

The hour is now! Another simple song that is great for beginners to learn. When the berimbau plays, that "I" go to play Capoeira. This is the spirit of the Capoeirsita. When they hear the berimbau, it pulls on their hearts to play the game of Capoeira. If you start to practice Capoeira, you'll understand how inviting the call of the berimbau can be.

## 6\. Ai ai ai ai São Bento me chama

| Portuguese | English |
| --- | --- |
| Ai ai ai ai  
São bento me chama  
  
**Ai ai ai ai  
**  
São bento me quer  
  
**Ai ai ai ai  
**  
Pra jogar capoeira  
  
**Ai ai ai ai  
**  
O meu mestre me chama  
  
**Ai ai ai ai  
**  
O meu mestre chamou | Ai ai ai ai  
São Bento calls me  
  
**Ai ai ai ai  
**  
Saint Benedict wants me  
  
**Ai ai ai ai  
**  
To play capoeira  
  
**Ai ai ai ai  
**  
My master calls me  
  
**Ai ai ai ai  
**  
My master called |

The Portuguese tried very hard to christianize the slaves of Brazil. In a strange turn of events, the slaves used the christian doctrine to hid their existing religious beliefs. São Bento would be a stand in for one of their gods (perhaps Oxum, Ogum, Oxala, etc.). On the surface, the song is asking for Saint Benedict for protection when they play Capoeira. One layer below that, you can see how the slaves used their creativity to continue practicing their religious beliefs. Capoeira does not have any religious affiliation. This is similar to how in America we say in the pledge of allegiance "...Under god, indivisible...". This line shows us how at one moment, America was a deeply christian country. Similarly, this song gives us a glimpse of the lives of the people who lived over 100 years ago.

**Oh areia, oh areia  
**Oh saia do meu caminho  
**Areia**  
Eu quero passar  
****Areia****  
Sou pequeninho  
**Areia**  
Filho de Oxala  
**Areia**  
Capoeira Angola  
**Areia**  
E comforme a razão  
**Areia**  
Da-me licença moça  
**Areia**  
Berimbau quebro  
**Areia**  
Eu quero pescar  
**Areia**  
Berimbau tocou  
**Areia**  
Eu vou vadiar  
**Areia**

**Areia**

**Sand**  
According to reason  
**Sand**  
Excuse me miss  
**Sand**

**Sand** |

The sand, the ocean, and the beach all had tremendous significance to the slaves of Brazil. They knew that across the ocean was their homelands. There are many references to fishing, the ocean, the beach etc. This is partially because in Brazil, the majority of the population lives near the beach. Many slaves worked on the docks of these beaches. The other reason is that the ocean was a constant reminder of the journey to Brazil. And that across the ocean was Africa.

## 8\. Gunga é meu

| Portuguese | English |
| --- | --- |
| Gunga é meu, gunga é meu  
Gunga é meu, é meu, é meu  
**Gunga é meu, gunga é meu**  
Gunga é meu foi meu pai que me deu  
**Gunga é meu, gunga é meu  
**O gunga e forte o esse gunga é meu  
**Gunga é meu, gunga é meu  
**Gunge é meu eu dou a ninguem  
**Gunga é meu, gunga é meu** | Gunga is mine, Gunga is mine  
Gunga is mine, is mine, is mine  
**Gunga is mine, Gunga is mine  
**Gunga is mine, it was my father who gave it to me  
**Gunga is mine, Gunga is mine  
**The Gunga is strong, this gunga is mine  
**Gunga is mine, Gunga is mine  
**Gunga is mine, I don't give it to anyone  
**Gunga is mine, Gunga is mine** |

The Gunga is the leader of the roda. They are like the DJ at the party. They decide what to play and how it is played. They control the atmosphere of the roda and are responsible for it. Capoeiristas hold their berimbaus dearly and do not easily let others play them. for some, the berimbau is almost a sacred instrument.

Caju in english means Cashew. This nut was seen to have many powers for healing people. This is another old song that has been passed down for many years. Today we might laugh at the thought of a cashew's healing properties, but that was the belief at the time. The song tells us to send Leco to get Cashews. From there, we can improvise with the song (which is often done with every Capoeira song). This song is great to learn improvisation. Start by calling out people's names. In the lyrics you can see the names of many famous mestres. You can also call out the names of some famous mestres or some friends that are with you.
