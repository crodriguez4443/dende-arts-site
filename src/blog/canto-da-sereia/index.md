| A onda quebrou na praia  
E molho tanta areia  
Foi la no fundo do mar  
Eu vi o canto da seria  
  
**A onda quebrou na praia  
E molho tanta areia**  
**Foi la no fundo do mar  
Eu vi o canto da seria**  
  
A sereia quando canta  
E bonito seu cantar  
No toque da viola  
Que eu aprendi jogar  
  
**A onda quebrou na praia  
E molho tanta areia  
Foi la no fundo do mar  
Eu vi o canto da seria** | The wave broke on the beach  
And so much sand  
It was there under the sea  
I saw the corner of the would  
  
The wave broke on the beach  
And so much sand  
It was there under the sea  
I saw the corner of the would  
  
The mermaid when she sings  
And beautiful your singing  
At the touch of the viola  
I learned to play  
  
The wave broke on the beach  
And so much sand  
It was there under the sea  
I saw the corner of the would |
