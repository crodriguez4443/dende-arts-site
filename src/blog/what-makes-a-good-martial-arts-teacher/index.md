These elements mxay not be clear during the first few classes, but every good teacher has some understanding of each one. The first is creating a safe classroom. The second is being able to engage their students in a fun teaching environment. The third is being connected to the greater community in their respective art. The fourth is the ability to inspire their students. And the last is encouraging the continued growth of their intermediate and advanced students.</td>

## Safety is always First

Nobody likes getting injured. **Injuries mean that you can't train, and that means you won't improve.** A well prepared teacher understands this and will do whatever they can to prevent injuries in their students.

**You might think, "yes but this is a martial art". Not all injuries can be avoided (as I'll mention later). But a good martial arts instructor can tell when they are needlessly putting their students in harms way.**

The rest of the document would follow the same pattern, with the table structure applied at the beginning. Note that since this is not a bilingual document with Portuguese and English lyrics, the table is populated with the English text.
