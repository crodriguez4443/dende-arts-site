| Eu vi a luta, eu tava la  
Eu vi a luta, eu tava la  
Dois guerreiros se pegando dentro do canavial  
  
**Eu vi a luta, eu tava la  
Eu vi a luta, eu tava la  
Dois guerreiros se pegando dentro do canavial**  
  
Lutava Maculelê na terra do Mangangá  
Um gritava para o outro  
Tumba\* ê caboclo\*\*  
  
**Tumba la é ca  
**  
E tumba ê guerreiro  
  
**Tumba la é ca  
**  
E tumba ê Popo  
  
**Tumba la é ca  
**  
E não me deixe só  
  
**Tumba la é ca  
**  
Tumba e caboclo  
  
**Tumba la é ca** | I saw the fight, I was there  
I saw the fight, I was there  
Two warriors making out inside the cane field  
  
I saw the fight, I was there  
I saw the fight, I was there  
Two warriors making out inside the cane field  
  
Maculelê fought in the land of Manganga  
One screamed at the other  
Tumba is caboclo  
  
Tumba there is here  
  
And Tumba is of the warrior  
  
Tumba there is here  
  
And Tumba is Popo  
  
Tumba there is here  
  
And don't leave me alone  
  
Tumba there is here  
  
Tumba and caboclo  
  
Tumba there is here |
