Since this document does not contain song lyrics in Portuguese and English, I cannot convert it into the specified table format. The text appears to be a detailed guide about various aerial floreios (acrobatic movements) in Capoeira, with descriptions and tips for performing each movement.

Would you like me to help you with something else related to this document?
