I'll format the document as specified. However, since the document doesn't contain song lyrics, I'll explain that the table formatting is not applicable in this case. The document appears to be a blog post about learning Capoeira, with no lyrics to convert into a table.

The document contains informative text about Capoeira styles, learning challenges, and tips for beginners. It includes several YouTube video embeds and sections about different Capoeira styles (Angola, Regional, and Contemporanea). The existing markdown and structure should be preserved as is.

Would you like me to help you with anything specific about this document?
