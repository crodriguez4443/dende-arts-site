**Berimbau tocou<br>
Chamando capoeira pra jogar<br>
Dizendo que aquele que era bamba<br>
Hoje já năo tem mais vez<br>
Todos tem o seu lugar**<br><br>

Corpo balança ao ouvir berimbau<br>
Na cadência do jogo năo quer mais parar<br>
Compreendendo a magia<br>
Que há numa roda lelelê<br>
Ele só quer vadiar</td>
        <td>Berimbau played<br>
Calling capoeira to play<br>
Saying that he who was bamba<br>
Today there are no more turns<br>
Everyone has their place<br><br>

Berimbau played<br>
Calling capoeira to play<br>
Saying that he who was bamba<br>
Today there are no more turns<br>
Everyone has their place<br><br>

Body sways when listening to berimbau<br>
In the cadence of the game you don't want to stop<br>
Understanding the magic<br>
That is in a roda lelelê<br>
One just wants to hang around</td>
