| Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Mareja, mareja  
  
**Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Mareja, mareja**  
  
Olha o mar é infinito  
Bonito por natureza  
Misterioso e delicado  
Igualzinho a capoeira  
  
**Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Mareja, mareja**  
  
Na onda vem areia  
Que volta pro mar  
Igualzinho a um capoeira  
Na hora de jogar  
**  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Mareja, mareja**  
  
É bonito de se ver  
Um bom jogo de capoeira  
Mas cuidado meu amigo  
Com esta beleza, capoeira  
  
**Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Olha a beleza do mar  
Mareja, mareja** | Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Mareja, mareja  
  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Mareja, mareja  
  
Look the sea is infinite  
Beautiful by nature  
Mysterious and delicate  
Just like capoeira  
  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Mareja, mareja  
  
In the wave comes sand  
That goes back to the sea  
Just like a capoeira  
When it's time to play  
  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Mareja, mareja  
  
It's beautiful to see  
A good capoeira game  
But watch out my friend  
With this beauty, capoeira  
  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Look at the beauty of the sea  
Mareja, mareja |
