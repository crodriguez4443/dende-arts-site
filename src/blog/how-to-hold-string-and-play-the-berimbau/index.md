Learning how to hold, string, and play the berimbau may be a daunting task at first glance. One of the fortunate things about the berimbau is that it is a relatively simple instrument to learn. There are few notes, and although the instrument is difficult to hold, anyone can learn to play it.

Although the berimbau is most closely associated with the art of Capoeira, this guide will provide steps to the instrument regardless if playing for capoeira is your goal. In this guide I'll go over the different parts of the berimbau, how to hold the instrument, how to play all three notes, exercises to hold the berimbau, and a few extra tips to mastering this instrument.

When you first look at the berimbau it might seem like a very odd instrument. It most closely resembles a bow (like in bow and arrows), but it comes from a family of instruments called the "musical bow". This family of instruments descends from many different cultures such as Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Although the berimbau is a Brazilian instrument it most likely has its origins in western Africa.
