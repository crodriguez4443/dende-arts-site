## KICKS, KICKS, KICKS!!!

I had two pretty important events happen to me recently that changed he way I trained. The first was going to the gym with my sister, who’s a beast and goes about 5 days a week for around 2 hours. It wasn’t so much the amount of time she trained as much as it was the intensity. There was always a decision to go super hard for that days workout. If you went for an hour, it was an intense hour. And if you went for 2 hours, it was an equally level of intensity for 2 hours.

The second thing was online training with the [“Bodyweight Warrior”, Tom Merrick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0DZhN-8KFLYO6beSaYljg). Really cool Youtube personality that has put himself at the front of bodyweight training. Many of his inspirations were mine, so I thought I could work on some deficiencies i had with him. Tom made me an awesome workout routine that compliments my Capoeira work. I follow it religiously, and can say that I have seen some great gains.

## THE TRAINING REGIMENT

After 6 weeks of this training regiment, I have order to my workout routine and know what I need to focus on. On top of that, I started training like I was with my sister at the gym. Timed, and with a high level of intensity. I set up goals, and they motivate me, which I know is a big issue with people who train alone.

## KICKS

Last real workout I did before I got the flu this week was seeing how many kicks I could do in 40 minutes. It was about 520 circular kicks, and I have to say it’s getting easier and easier. At first I did 140, then 250, then after figuring out what my rhythm was I was able to do 500+ in 40 minutes. The huge increase in kicking stamina is one benefit I’ve seen thus far. I’m really happy with this new style of training and am looking forward to developing it and sharing it as I go along.

The best way to follow this progress would be on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dende_arts/?hl=en).

Happy training
