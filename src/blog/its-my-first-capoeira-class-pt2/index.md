## WHAT DO I BRING!?

If you're anything like me, you like to be prepared! Ready for anything that can happen, and it doesn't matter if it's rain, snow, or a zombie attack. It pays to be ready, but how do you get ready for a Capoeira class if you’ve never been to one before? Your mind might be racing with questions like: Do I bring a yoga Mat? Should I wear compression pants? Will a tank top look silly? Do I need to bring a towel or water?

Let me go ahead and break it down for you!

Capoeira, like many other martial arts, has a “uniform”, similar to how one is used for karate and Jiu-Jitsu. The traditional uniform is a white shirt and white pants called “[Abadas](http://www.capoeira-world.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/white-abada-pants2-500x750.jpg)” (this does varies slightly group to group). When you walk into class you will probably see a couple people in these whites, but in many classes you see people with some kind of athletic pants with a workout shirt on top. For many groups this is all you need to train, some long pants and a shirt you're willing to swear in.

For other special events however some groups require you to wear your uniform. This isn't always the case but it's nice to check in with the teacher to see what they prefer. Some groups require that you wear a uniform during all training sessions, but if you’re new you don’t need to worry about this. For someone who is new, I recommend some long pants that are stretchy (please don’t wear jeans if possible!) and some sort of athletic shirt. The shirt can be basically anything you would wear to the gym.

## ACCESSORIES

Capoeira is a unique sport in that doesn't require any accessories. Unlike yoga there are no yoga mats, blocks, balls, wheels, or anything else that you really need to do Capoeira (except for a partner).  When you think about what to bring with you, think about the basics. If you get a little sweaty you can bring a small towel. If you get thirsty during those classes, you can bring water bottle. Other than that, your teacher will most likely provide everything needed, unless they let me know otherwise.

## SHOES

i'll keep it real here.  Most people have delicate feet and are afraid to take off their shoes in the beginning. It's very tempting to say to yourself, “I have these brand new shoes that I got from the store that are going to enhance my mobility, keep my ankle stable, and do everything for me that my feet won't”. The fact of the matter is that you want to spend as much time as you can with your shoes off. When your feet get sore, that's not a bad thing that's your body learning and getting stronger.

This may be difficult for some people, so if you’re someone who struggles with this, I suggest going barefoot is much is possible in the house. Having said that, having a pair of shoes that you can bring to class in case your feet start to feel a little raw is not a bad idea! More on what kind of shoes you should look into in a future post.

## THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BRING

The most important to bring is an open mind. An open mind will take you further than any exercise accessory on the market. Keep that in mind as you go into your first class. You might be thinking about how silly some movements are and how weird your body feels, but the point is to stick with it and push forward. Have some faith that your mind and your body will learn something as you take it through this new and exciting ride.
