            Capoeira is a martial art that is primarily done with bare feet. However, there are times when using shoes can be appropriate. Maybe you have a blister on your foot or maybe you're doing Capoeira in the concrete. <strong>Whatever the reason it's important to be prepared and have a good pair of capoeira shoes with you that lets you move</strong>. Here is a list of a few of those shoes and with summaries of what makes them great and what things they lack.

            <strong>So which shoe has the best value and which is best overall? The shoe with the best value is the Feiyue and the best overall shoe to use for Capoeira is the Vivo Barefoot</strong>. Both these shoes have their downsides, however, the rainha gives amazing value for a price that can't be beaten. This shoe gives you just about everything you could ask for, for a price that anyone can afford. On the other end of the spectrum is the Vivo Barefoot, which is more pricey but gives you exactly what you want in a shoe for capoeira. The feeling you get while wearing these is unbelievable and explained in depth below.

Note: Since there was no Portuguese text in the original document, I left the Portuguese column empty. The rest of the document remains exactly the same as the original markdown.
