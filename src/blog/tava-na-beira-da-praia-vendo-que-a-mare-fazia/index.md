| Tava na beira da praia vendo que maré fazia  
**Coro  
Tava na beira da praia vendo que maré fazia**  
Tava na beira da praia vendo que maré fazia  
**Tava na beira da praia vendo que maré fazia  
**  
Quando eu ia ela voltava  
**Quando eu volto ela ia  
**Quando eu ia ela voltava  
**Quando eu volto ela ia**  
Mas eu ia ela voltava  
**Quando eu volto ela ia**  
 | I was on the edge of the beach, seeing what the tide would do  
**Chorus  
I was on the edge of the beach, seeing what the tide would do**  
I was on the edge of the beach, seeing what the tide would do  
**I was on the edge of the beach, seeing what the tide would do  
**  
When I went, she returned  
**When I returned, she went  
**When I went, she returned  
**When I returned, she went  
**But I went, she returned  
**When I returned, she went** |

## **Explanation:**

The song "Tava na beira da praia vendo que maré fazia" is simple like many Capoeira songs, but reflects a lot of the ideas that are prevalent in the game of Capoeira. The song emphasizing the movements of the tide at the beach, mirroring the ebb and flow of a capoeira game, where movements and responses are in a constant push and pull between the capoeiristas in the roda (circle).

"When I went, she returned; When I return, she went," captures the dialogue between capoeiristas. This call and response is fundamental to capoeira, not just in the physical game played, but also in the call and response of the audience singing and responding to the person leading the bateria.

The lyrics also poignantly reflect the idea of going with the flow. As you go, the tide come in and as you go in, the tide go away. The simplicity of the lyrics leaves room for multiple interpretations, often typical in capoeira songs, which can be reflective, philosophical, or playful, adding layers of meaning to the practice and its traditions. One one hand we could be talking about something we can do (watch the time), something we share, (the call and response of the game and music), or the philosophical nature of going with the flow.
