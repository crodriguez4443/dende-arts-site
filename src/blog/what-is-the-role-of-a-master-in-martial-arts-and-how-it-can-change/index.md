The provided document does not contain any song lyrics in Portuguese and English, so I cannot apply the table formatting specification. This appears to be a blog post about martial arts teaching methods and the evolving relationship between teachers and students in Capoeira.

Would you like me to help you with something specific about this document, or do you have a different markdown file with song lyrics that needs formatting?
