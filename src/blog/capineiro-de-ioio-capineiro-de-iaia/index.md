Não corte capim daí

Só corte quando eu mandar

Não mexa com marimbondo

Na fazenda do Sertão  
A tristeza era demais  
  
**Na fazenda do Sertão  
A tristeza era demais  
**  
Era a cana na moenda  
  
**Pra faser garapa**\*  
  
Era milho no pilão  
  
**Pra fazer fubá  
**  
Eu andava sete léguas  
  
**Sem olhar pra trás  
**  
Cada passo que eu dava  
  
**Era um capataz  
**  
Capineiro que corta cana  
No meio do canavial

No meio do canavial** | Capineer from yo-yo, capineiro from iaia  
Capineer from yo-yo, capineiro from iaia  
  
Don't cut grass from there  
  
Capineiro  
  
Only cut when I send  
  
Capineiro  
  
Don't mess with wasp  
  
Capineiro  
  
In the trunk of the mangangá  
  
Capineiro  
  
At the backwater farm  
The sadness was too much  
  
At the backwater farm  
The sadness was too much  
  
It was the cane in the mill  
  
To faser garapa  
  
It was corn in the pestle  
  
To make cornmeal  
  
I walked seven leagues  
  
Without looking back  
  
Every step I took  
  
Was a foreman  
  
Capineer who cuts cane  
In the middle of the cane field
