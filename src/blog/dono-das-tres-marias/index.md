| Vou lá pra beira do mar  
Berimbau tocou  
Chamou pra jogar  
  
**Vou lá pra beira do mar  
Berimbau tocou  
Chamou pra jogar**  
  
Berimbau tocou, chamou pra jogar  
**Berimbau tocou, chamou pra jogar**  
  
Berimbau por que me chama  
Por que mandou me chamar  
Quando escuto o seu chamado  
Eu vou pra qualquer lugar  
  
Vou lá pra beira do mar  
Berimbau tocou  
Chamou pra jogar  
  
**Vou lá pra beira do mar  
Berimbau tocou  
Chamou pra jogar**  
  
Berimbau tocou, chamou pra jogar  
**Berimbau tocou, chamou pra jogar**  
  
Berimbau tocou na roda  
Fez meu corpo arrepiar  
Só quem joga capoeira  
Sabe a vontade que dá  
  
Vou lá pra beira do mar  
Berimbau tocou  
Chamou pra jogar  
  
**Vou lá pra beira do mar  
Berimbau tocou  
Chamou pra jogar**  
  
Berimbau tocou, chamou pra jogar  
**Berimbau tocou, chamou pra jogar**  
  
Ai meu Deus se eu pudesse  
Ser dono das Três Marias  
Dava uma a Mestre Bimba  
A outra a Mestre Pastinha  
E a estrela que sobrasse  
Eu guardava pra ser minha  
  
Vou lá pra beira do mar  
Berimbau tocou  
Chamou pra jogar  
  
**Vou lá pra beira do mar  
Berimbau tocou  
Chamou pra jogar**  
  
Berimbau tocou, chamou pra jogar  
**Berimbau tocou, chamou pra jogar** | I'm going over to the seaside  
Berimbau played  
Called me to play  
  
I'm going over to the seaside  
Berimbau played  
Called me to play  
  
Berimbau played, called me to play  
Berimbau played, called me to play  
  
Berimbau why did you call me  
Why did you send for me  
When I hear your call  
I'll go anywhere  
  
I'm going over to the seaside  
Berimbau played  
Called me to play  
  
I'm going over to the seaside  
Berimbau played  
Called me to play  
  
Berimbau played, called me to play  
Berimbau played, called me to play  
  
Berimbau played in the roda  
It gave me goosebumps  
Only those who play capoeira  
You know desire it brings  
  
I'm going over to the seaside  
Berimbau played  
Called me to play  
  
I'm going over to the seaside  
Berimbau played  
Called me to play  
  
Berimbau played, called me to play  
Berimbau played, called me to play  
  
Oh my God if I could  
Own the Three Marys  
I'd give one to MEstre Bimba  
The other to Mestre Pastinha  
And the remaining star  
I'd keep to be mine  
  
I'm going over to the seaside  
Berimbau played  
Called me to play  
  
I'm going over to the seaside  
Berimbau played  
Called me to play  
  
Berimbau played, called me to play  
Berimbau played, called me to play |
