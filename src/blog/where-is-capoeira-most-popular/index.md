Okay, I can't extract song lyrics from the provided text. The text is an article about the popularity of Capoeira based on Google Trends data. It discusses countries and cities where Capoeira is frequently searched.

However, if you provide me with actual song lyrics in Portuguese and English, I can format them into an HTML table as requested.

For example, if you gave me this:

**Portuguese:**
"Capoeira, Capoeira,<br>
Na roda a gente joga,<br>
Com ginga e com malícia,<br>
A vida a gente dobra."

**English:**
"Capoeira, Capoeira,<br>
In the roda we play,<br>
With sway and with cunning,<br>
Life we bend our way."

Then I could generate the following HTML:


<table class="capoeira-table">
    <tr class="header-row">
        <th>Portuguese</th>
        <th>English</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Capoeira, Capoeira,<br>Na roda a gente joga,<br>Com ginga e com malícia,<br>A vida a gente dobra.</td>
        <td>Capoeira, Capoeira,<br>In the roda we play,<br>With sway and with cunning,<br>Life we bend our way.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

**Please provide the song lyrics you want me to format.**
