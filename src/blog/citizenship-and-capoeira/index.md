## TRY, LEARN, REPEAT

A good friend of mine in Capoeira got his citizenship this past week. I'm going to his batizado (belt ceremony) now to congratulate him and celebrate the event.

Over the years I've seen a lot of people gain American citizenship. Everyone who comes from another country just wants to be successful in the thing that they love and be part of the country that they moved to. Although the current Trump administration makes things difficult for people with those aspirations, people don't stop trying. There's always a way. After close to 20 years, my friend is finally American, and I couldn't be happier for him.

This is going to be a pretty happy feeling roda.

The capoeira family is gathering to paaaartttaaaayyy!
