        What is the difference between spring training capoeira and Brazil versus training capoeira in the United States? Sometimes we think in the United States that capoeira can only be learned correctly in Brazil. However I don't believe this is true, however I do think that there are some differences and this article is meant to highlight will we can learn as Americans from the way people train in Brazil.

## Is Capoeira in Brazil better and why?

        What is the difference between training Capoeira in Brazil vs in America? A lot of times I'll go on YouTube and look up capoeira, and the quality of the games seem out of this world. It might feel like the people who train in Brazil are superhumans, or that they've all been training since they were little kids; and there's no way that you can reach the same level. This is not true. You <strong>can</strong> definitely reach a high level of Capoeira that many Brazilians would be jealous of. The question is what can we learn from our Capoeira brothers and sisters in Brazil.
