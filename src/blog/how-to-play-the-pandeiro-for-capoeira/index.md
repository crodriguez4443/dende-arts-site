The Brazilian pandeiro, is a percussion instrument that belongs to the frame drum family. Earlier versions of it, originally emerged from Arabia and Northern Africa. It was later developed in Portugal and Galicia, and brought to Brazil by Portuguese colonists.  
In Brazil, a country blessed with very rich and diverse musical traditions, the pandeiro is one of the most prominent instruments across almost every style of Brazilian music. Some of Brazil and the world's most renowned pandeiro players, are featured extensively in samba music, as well as all of its sub genres and associated styles.  
In capoeira, a Brazilian art form with similar cultural relevance as Samba music. The pandeiro is an integral part of the bater√≠a (the ensemble of music al instruments playing the rhythms that capoeira practitioners move to), being the second instrument in importance after the berimbau, the musical bow that dictates the atmosphere of capoeira games.

The pandeiro consists of a wooden (or plastic) circular frame, with a drumhead made of goatskin, cowhide, or plastic.

1. Goatskin drum head.
2. Jingles (or platinelas). In this instrument: 5 pairs.
3. Adjustable tuning hooks. In this instrument: 6 hooks.
4. Wood frame.

Depending on how the head is attached to the frame, the pandeiro tuning can be adjustable (if attached with tuning hooks), or fixed (if tacked in place).  
Additionally, the pandeiro displays several metal jingles, or platinelas arranged in pairs, which produce a crisp, metallic sound that complements that of the head when hit by one hand, while being held by the other.

## **Technique:**

Proper technique varies according to the instructor, the musical style, or the school. In samba as well as in other forms of contemporary music, the pandeiro is perceived as a portable drum kit, with plenty of room for advanced playing techniques. In capoeira tradition, however, the pandeiro is an accompanying instrument, second to the berimbau, and therefore any playing technique should be applied to hold down the rhythm, while controlling its volume and dynamic output, so as to not undermine the berimbau.  
With this in mind, let's review a few basic approaches to each hand:

## **The holding hand:**

Depending on how many pairs of platinelas the instrument has, the pandeiro frame is divided in sections, with one pair per section. There's one section that has no jingles, which is where the pandeiro is held from.
