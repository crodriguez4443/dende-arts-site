| Foi na Lapa, foi na Lapa  
Que Madame Satã, acabava com a briga no soco e no de tapa  
Foi na Lapa  
  
**Foi na Lapa, foi na Lapa**  
  
Que manduca chegava, que manduca batia, que manduca espantava  
Foi na Lapa  
  
**Foi na Lapa, foi na Lapa**  
  
A policia chegava, a policia apanhava, a policia aplicava  
Foi na Lapa  
  
**Foi na Lapa, foi na Lapa**  
  
A navalha cortando o caboclo sangrando  
Foi na Lapa  
  
**Foi na Lapa, foi na Lapa**  
  
Berço da malandragem, da capoeiragem  
Foi na Lapa  
  
**Foi na Lapa, foi na Lapa**  
  
Tem historia de bamba, de capoeira, do samba  
Foi na lapa  
  
**Foi na Lapa, foi na Lapa** | It was in Lapa, it was in Lapa  
  
That Madame Satã, ended the fight with punches and slaps  
It was in Lapa  
  
It was in Lapa, it was in Lapa  
  
That manduca arrived, that manduca beat, that manduca amazed  
It was in Lapa  
  
It was in Lapa, it was in Lapa  
  
The police arrived, the police was beaten, the police applied  
It was in Lapa  
  
It was in Lapa, it was in Lapa  
  
The razor cutting, the caboclo bleeding  
It was in Lapa  
  
It was in Lapa, it was in Lapa  
  
Cradle of trickery, of capoeira  
It was in Lapa  
  
It was in Lapa, it was in Lapa  
  
There's a history of bamba, of capoeira, and samba  
It was in the lapa  
  
It was in Lapa, it was in Lapa |
