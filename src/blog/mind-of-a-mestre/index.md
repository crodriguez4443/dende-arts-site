## EATS AXÉ FOR BREAKFAST

Back around 2007 I remember watching pixelated videos of Mestre Poncianinho moving in ways I didn’t know were possible. To me, and many other capoeiristas, he was near the top of what a Capoeirista was physically was capable of. The floreios and the flow was inspirational. Here’s a video of him playing the legend, Mestre Cobra Mansa. This is one of my favorite youtube [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgJcdbVYggE) of all time.

Poncianinho is the son of Mestre Jose Antonio, a student of Mestre suassuna. Poncianinho played Capoeira all his life and was named after his uncle, Mestre Ponciano. A family of Capoeira! In 2004, at the age of 24, Poncianinho received the title of Mestre, one of the youngest to achieve the rank. So basically, this man was eyeballs deep in axé, and if there’s a mestre who’s mind I want to get into, it’s this guy!

## M. PONCIANINHOS VLOG

This man has been a Mestre for a long time. Now, 38, Mestre Poncianinho has started releasing vlogs about his thoughts on Capoeira. The project is part of a New Years resolution of his, and it's a great service to the world of Capoeira.

The things he talks about are topics everyone who practices Capoeira can relate to: being in the zone, learning about what “malandragem” means, how and why to do a chamada, etc. All this from the perspective of someone who went through the process of learning just like anyone else and eventually became a Mestre. It’s really rare opportunity to get this perspective so if you get a chance, check it out! Here is a [link to his vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESiEStGWp90). Just to reiterate, Mestre Poncianinho’s vlog series is a gift to everyone interested in Capoeira and a great way to get into the mind of a Mestre who many consider to be a visionary in the global community.

## MIND OF A MESTRE

If you’re interested in learning more about the lives of the old guard of Mestres, check out my [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnqgiTmIGYQ) on the biography of Mestre Suassuna, written by Mestre Boca Rica. A great way to deepen your knowledge of Capoeira, and learn a bit about the culture behind this great art.
