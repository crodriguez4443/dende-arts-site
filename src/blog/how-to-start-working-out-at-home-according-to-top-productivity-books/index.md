I apologize, but the document you've provided is a blog post about working out at home, not a markdown document with song lyrics in Portuguese and English. The formatting instructions you mentioned are for a song lyrics document with a bilingual table. 

Would you like me to:
1. Format this blog post in some way?
2. Confirm that you meant to send a different document with song lyrics?
3. Proceed with the original formatting instructions using this blog post text?

Please clarify which approach you'd like me to take.
