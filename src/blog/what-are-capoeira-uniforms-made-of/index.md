I understand you want me to format the markdown document's table structure. However, I don't see a table in this markdown document. The document appears to be a blog post about Capoeira uniforms and the history of Helanca fabric. 

Would you like me to:
1. Create a table from some part of the text?
2. Leave the document as-is?
3. Confirm if there's a specific table you want formatted?

Could you clarify your request?
