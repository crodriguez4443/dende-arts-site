| Era o tempo de Bamba ae  
Era tempo de Bamba  
Era tempo da roda de rua, é aqui  
De São Paulo, eu também estava lá  
  
**Coro  
Era o tempo da Bamba ae  
Era tempo de Bamba**  
  
Oi, Era tempo da roda de rua,  
é a lá na República, eu também fui lá  
  
**Coro  
Era o tempo da Bamba ae  
Era tempo de Bamba**  
  
Olha, Mestre Anania, Jaguará, Cavaco,  
Também Mestre Chita ao som do Berimbau,  
Ritmo cadenciado, malicia e maldade  
Angola e Regional  
Mestre Sesi(?), Guabana, Tijolo, O seu Peixe,  
Fazia um Chutado no ar, O Cavaco no Au sem mão  
E vários Xangô no mesmo lugar  
  
**Coro  
Era o tempo da Bamba ae  
Era tempo de Bamba**  
  
Era o tempo de Bamba ae  
Era tempo de Bamba  
Era tempo da roda de rua, é aqui  
de São Paulo, eu também estava lá.

**Coro  
Era o tempo da Bamba ae  
Era tempo de Bamba**  
  
Oi, Mestre Gigante, bateu aberto,  
E gingava seu corpo com muita expressão,  
E Chitu era muito técnico e muito mandingueiro,  
Era Mestre Falão,  
Mestre Anania, que estava na roda,  
Cantando e tocando o seu Berimbau,  
Meia Lua, pernada ligeira, da au, da rastreira,  
Ela era fenomenal.  
  
**Coro  
Era o tempo da Bamba ae  
Era tempo de Bamba**  
  
Oi, Era tempo da roda de rua,  
é a lá na República, eu também fui lá.  
  
**Coro  
Era o tempo da Bamba ae  
Era tempo de Bamba**  
  
Ah, todos os Domingos de roda,  
Oi Fitinha tocando, e a lá eu joguei,  
Deixe os dois no quebra gereba  
Na volta do mundo eles vão se entender.  
Hoje, foi do samba de roda,  
Toda alegria, e muito lindo de se ver,  
Ta galera, lá na beira no cais,  
Tempos De Bamba, que não voltam mais.  
  
**Coro  
Era o tempo da Bamba ae

E, o seu Cobrinha já estava, por lá.

Ah, every Sunday circle,  
Hi Fitinha playing, and there I played,  
Leave them both in the gereba break  
Around the world they will understand each other.  
Today, it was samba de roda,  
All joy, and very beautiful to see,  
Hey guys, there on the edge of the pier,  
Times of Bamba, which never come back.

Song as sung by DJ Capoeira at the Praça da Republica

</figcaption>

Bamba - refers to a tough buy. or the very best players in this case. The song is calling for you to show your very best.

Note, there are MANY improvisations in this translation. the singer in this case references many capoeiristas and locations that are specific to them. Feel free to include do the same and mention places or people that have to do with you. Keeping with the theme of the song, they should be Bambas.
