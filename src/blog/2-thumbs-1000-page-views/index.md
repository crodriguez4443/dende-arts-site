## WHO HAS 2 THUMBS AND BLOGS' GET 1000+ VIEWS!

yes... this guy =)

About one year ago I created a blog section for my website and started creating articles relating to Capoeira. This year long effort has been focused on bringing light to some questions that I had about Capoeira. What is the [history](https://dendearts.com/a-brief-history-of-capoeira/) of Capoeira? What is it like being a [newbie](https://dendearts.com/i-cant-even-do-a-cartwheel/) doing Capoeira? How can we deal with issues of sexual [harassment](https://dendearts.com/sexual-misconduct/) in our sport? What are the origins of [Mestre Suassuna](https://dendearts.com/video-the-biography-of-mestre-suassuna/)? And more.

I installed Google Analytics to my page shortly after creating my blog to keep track of progress and the numbers at the beginning were pretty sad. Nobody seemed to know I existed and i was worried this effort was for nothing. Now after dozens of posts I can safely say that it wasn't for nothing. The Capoeira 101 Blog is ranked #10 on Google for Capoeira blogs, and last month the blog received 1000 views!

## A LONG WAY TO GO

In blogging terms, this is still not that much, and there is still a long way to go, but persistence is key and knowing that there's an audience willing to listen to you is rewarding. Thanks to my readers! Because of this blog I have been connected to people in France, Germany, Britain, among other countries. I'm hoping that the audience continues to expand and we can start a genuine conversation about Capoeira, and how we can improve this community that we love so much. So keep training and I'll catch you guys on the next post.

Oh and for those interested, I moved a couple operations over to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxiwDy2xQUf_B5KkONrrzGg). The channel is still pretty young, but I can't wait to create valuable content on there for you guys as well.
