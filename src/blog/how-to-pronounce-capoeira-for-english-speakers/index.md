If you want to train Capoeira, it might be a good idea to know how to say the name of the martial art. There's nothing wrong with mispronouncing Capoeira, it's not the easiest word for English speakers. But this guide can help you figure out how to say the word and hopefully a few other words that you'll encounter in the Capoeira world. Capoeira is a Brazilian word by origin, and spoken in Portuguese.

Capoeira is pronounced like this, \[ka-po-wei-ra\]. The brackets dissect the words into digestible parts that we can try to wrap our english speaking brains around. The pronunciation is not that simple, so I will go over these four syllables to make it clear how each is produced and how we as english speakers can say the word, without feeling any sort of embarrassment.
