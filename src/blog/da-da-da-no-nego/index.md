| Dá dá dá no nego  
**Dá dá dá no nego**  
  
No nego você não dá  
**Dá dá dá no nego**  
  
Mas se der vai apanhar  
**Dá dá dá no nego**  
  
No nego você não dá  
**Dá dá dá no nego**  
  
Jogue o nego para cima  
**Dá dá dá no nego**  
  
Deixa o nego vadiar  
**Dá dá dá no nego**  
  
No nego você não dá  
**Dá dá dá no nego** | Give it, give it to the black  
Give it, give it to the black  
  
You can't give it to him  
Give it, give it to the black  
  
But if you do, you'll get beat  
Give it, give it to the black  
  
You can't give it to him  
Give it, give it to the black  
  
Throw him in the air  
Give it, give it to the black  
  
Let him play  
Give it, give it to the black  
  
You can't give it to him  
Give it, give it to the black |

Author: Unknown (Do you know who wrote this song? Tell us in the comments!)  
  
T/L: "Give it to the black \[man\]" is in the sense of "get him, beat him, teach him a lesson". I wanted to write a small comment on this song as translated and out of context, it can come off as a bit strange! I think one way to interpret this song is as though there are two different parties speaking. On one side, you have those inciting violence against a black man, or perhaps issuing a challenge. On the other side, you have those saying that one can't actually do anything against this black man, because he is far too clever, and fast, and too good a capoeirista.
