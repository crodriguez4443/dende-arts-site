Author: Unknown (Do you know who wrote this song? Tell us in the comments!)  
  
T/L: "Give it to the black \[man\]" is in the sense of "get him, beat him, teach him a lesson". I wanted to write a small comment on this song as translated and out of context, it can come off as a bit strange! I think one way to interpret this song is as though there are two different parties speaking. On one side, you have those inciting violence against a black man, or perhaps issuing a challenge. On the other side, you have those saying that one can't actually do anything against this black man, because he is far too clever, and fast, and too good a capoeirista.
