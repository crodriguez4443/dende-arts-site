## TRY, LEARN, REPEAT

## TRY, LEARN, REPEAT

Capoeira is a seductive martial art. The movement is respected, the feats are awed at, and the fun is felt by everyone in the area. I have mentioned this before, but I train on a concrete floor. For the vast majority of people, myself included, this means you have to be sharp and that you might not try floreios that you otherwise would. This is where the beach comes in. The sand, the water. The scene is set for a day of play and experimentation, where if you fall badly or make some mistakes, you’ll learn without damaging your body.

## THERE IS NO FAILURE, ONLY LEARNING

Many people get scared when thinking about doing flips, jumping in the air, and needing to trust in your own ability to keep you safe. When it comes to floreios, confidence is the number one thing you need. I’ve seen obese kids doing all kinds of flips on youtube. The secret is mind over matter. The back-tuck is a great example. Technically challenging, but most people with some minimal level of physical fitness have the capacity to do it. The challenge is mostly in the monkey brain, which goes off on how you could fall on your arm, your neck, etc. Your mind races about all the things that could go wrong, instead of focusing on the task at hand. Jump up, tuck tight, stick the landing.

If you have the chance to go to the beach before the summer ends, make sure you try whatever you can. Au sem mão, Mortal, Au de Frente, etc. I have no doubt you’ll fail and you’ll fall, but on the beach as anywhere else, there is no failure, only learning.

## WHERE ON THE BEACH?

The best place in my experience to practice these moves is on the edge of the beach between the water and the dry sand. The wet sand usually slopes a bit towards the ocean, giving you a little extra height when doing your jumps. This makes it perfect for any explosive/jumping movements. Practicing in shallow water or dry sand can work, but it typically eats your momentum. One bit of advice, careful with kids running around the beach!

## FUN

Don’t forget to have fun! You’re on the F\*\*\*\* beach. Go out there with some friends and enjoy the sun, the sand, the water, and the Capoeira.

## PLANS AND 50 YEAR OF CDO

This week I will be heading to Detroit to hang out with Contra Mestre Baz and the Cordão de Ouro group out there. I have a good feeling about this event and am excited to meet some of the superstars like Mestre Noa from Capoeira CDO Israel. I will be posting a post about this event and will try to do the same for future events.

As for Cordão de Ouro’s 50 year anniversary, I unfortunately was not able to go, but will be speaking with people who went, watching videos, etc. to write a little summary of the event. Look forward to future posts. There’s a lot of things happening on the back end that I’m looking forward to putting up on this blog in the near future!
