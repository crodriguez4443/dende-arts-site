There are many different cartwheel variations for beginners to advanced movers. This overview contains progressions and variations for absolute beginners and hardcore crazy people who will try anything. Use the ratings as a reference tool. They are very subjective and might not reflect your journey doing cartwheels.

## **Core Cartwheels**

If you are a beginner, this is where you want to start. This is especially the case if you are afraid of cartwheels or feel that you don't have the coordination to do a cartwheel correctly. The core cartwheels take you through the absolute fundamentals. More advanced people might be inclined to gloss over this section, but I highly suggest taking a look. There are tons of things to learn, by training the fundamentals

### **Beginner Cartwheel (Au de Iniciante)**

Difficulty: ⭐

This lovely variation is incredibly useful for beginners, intermediate, and advanced practitioners. Don't think that just because this is a beginner movement, that it's for the noobs only. Everyone can benefit from making this foundational movement smooth and efficient. the beginner Au is very helpful in terms of building your proprioception. This is key for all variations on this list. Add some difficulty by prolonging the time you spend on a single hand.

### **"V" Cartwheel (Au de "V")**

Difficulty: ⭐

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Au de "V"</td>
        <td>"V" Cartwheel</td>
    </tr>

This variation allows us to start small and create a framework for how we can approach the majority of the variations below. Instead of doing the full cartwheel, we are going to move in a "V" shape. This gives us more control and decreases the mobility demands on our wrists, hamstrings, and shoulders.

If moving your legs over your body is still scary to you, I highly suggest hovering your feet slightly above the ground. We want to get comfortable moving laterally to make it easier to do more advanced variations. Over time, progress to a wider and wider "V", until it is essentially straight. Start by hovering the feet over the ground and slowly progress by kicking the back leg at harder up to get your trunk above your hips.
