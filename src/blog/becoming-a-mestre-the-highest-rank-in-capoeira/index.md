I noticed that this document does not contain a song with lyrics in Portuguese and English, which was part of the original instructions. The document appears to be a blog post about becoming a Mestre in Capoeira. Would you like me to proceed with formatting the blog post text, or are you expecting me to work with song lyrics that were not included in this document?

If you want me to format this blog post, I can help you with that, but it would require a different approach than the table-based markdown conversion specified in the original instructions.

Could you clarify what you would like me to do?
