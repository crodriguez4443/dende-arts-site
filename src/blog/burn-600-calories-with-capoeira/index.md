## 600? SERIOUSLY???

Recently I've been finding many articles talk about how many calories you can burn doing this exercise vs that exercise. According to one [blog](https://siriroom.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/want-to-burn-500-calories-an-hour-go-to-capoeira/), a 1 hour class of Capoeira can burn around 500 calories. Some articles mention 600, but there doesn’t seem to be any good data to reference, just some really rough estimations. Looking at yoga, some articles estimate anywhere from [300](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/cardio/calories-burned-for-yoga-is-it-enough-for-weight-loss.html) to [600](https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Total-Calories-Burned-During-Popular-Yoga-Classes-16392584) calories burned during a 1 hour class. The huge range and the lack of evidence made me question if measuring calories burned from exercise was actually the way to measure fitness or even weight loss. Spoiler, it's not.

An [article](https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11518804/weight-loss-exercise-myth-burn-calories) written by Vox talks about how exercise is not the way to lose weight. To summarize the article, exercise only covers a small percentage of the calories you burn during a given day. Controlling your diet is much more effective. Take out sugar and other junk foods would go much further it helping maintain a healthy weight.

Ok so we can safely say, running until you can't anymore just to loose some pounds is not the way to go. So if working out doesn't do much to lose weight, why bother?

## MODERN DAY BULLSHIT

The mantra of burning calories and losing weight is a load of modern day bullshit. What makes you healthy isn't calculating calories, staring at the scale or feeling anxiety over your small indulgences over the day. For the vast majority of you who just want to be fit and healthy, just move. Move often, and don’t stop moving. Do something that gets you going and you have fun while doing it.

For me it's Capoeira. The movements, the friends, the traveling to events, the challenges that never end. Capoeira will challenge you forever and at the same time, gives you a tribe to struggle with.

## BUT CAN I BURN 600 CALORIES?

I don't know if 1 hour of Capoeira burns 600 calories and frankly I don't care. That stuff is all irrelevant when you consider the benefits of inhabiting a fit body that is strong, can move without pain, and is free to do as the mind dictates. At that point, who cares if you gained 10 pounds, if those 10 pounds are muscle that works in harmony with the rest of your body. #Fitnessgoalsoverweightgoals.
