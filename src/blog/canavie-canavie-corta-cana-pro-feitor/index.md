| No meio do canavial  
Uma chance pra viver  
Se morria por lutar  
Então cortava pra não morrer  
  
**Canaviê, Canaviê  
Canaviê, Canaviê**  
  
Corta cana pro feitor  
Luta disfarçada de dança  
Responde pro mal feitor  
Com ponta-pés e cabeçadas  
Negro diz, não vou  
  
**Canaviê, Canaviê  
Corta cana pro feitor  
**  
Com sangue nas mãos  
Pro feitor uma surpresa  
Se plantava cana e o que nascia  
Era a Capoeira  
Canaviê  
  
**Canaviê, Canaviê  
Corta cana pro feitor** | In the middle of the cane field  
A chance to live  
If he died to fight  
So I cut it so I wouldn't die  
  
Sugar can worker, sugar cane worker  
Sugar can worker, sugar cane worker  
  
Cut cane to the foreman  
Fighting disguised dance  
Respond to the evil factor  
With toes and headbutt  
Negro says, I will not  
  
Sugar can worker, sugar cane worker  
Cut cane to the foreman  
  
With blood on hands  
Pro factor a surprise  
If sugar cane was planted and what was born  
It was Capoeira  
Sugar can worker  
  
Sugar can worker, sugar cane worker  
Cut cane to the foreman |
