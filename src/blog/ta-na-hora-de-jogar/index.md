| Ta na hora de jogar  
Vamos la vadiar  
  
**Ta na hora de jogar  
Vamos la vadiar**  
  
O Berimbau me convido  
E nao posso recusar  
Eu benzo o meu corpo  
E entro para jogar  
  
**Ta na hora de jogar  
Vamos la vadiar**  
  
E quando chega a hora  
Para mim e uma alegria  
Eu pego no Berimbau  
e comeso a canturia  
  
**Ta na hora de jogar  
Vamos la vadiar**  
  
A roda passa no meio  
Berimbau falo assim  
O jogo termina agora  
Capoeira nao tem fim  
  
**Ta na hora de jogar  
Vamos la vadiar**  
  
Pra que vive Capoeira  
Quando o Berimbau desarma  
e uma tristeza no espirito  
Os olhos enchendo dâ€™agua  
  
**Ta na hora de jogar  
Vamos la vadiar**  
  
eu vou eu vou, vou vadiar  
  
**eu vou eu vou, vou vadiar  
**  
Ta na hora de jogar  
Vamos la vadiar  
  
**Ta na hora de jogar  
Vamos la vadiar**  
  
eu vou eu vou, vou vadiar  
  
**eu vou eu vou, vou vadiar** | It's time to play  
let's vadiar  
  
It's time to play  
let's vadiar  
  
The berimbau invites me  
And I can't refuse  
I bless my body  
and I go in to play  
  
It's time to play  
let's vadiar  
  
And when the time comes  
for me and a joy  
I pick up at Berimbau  
and eat cantery  
  
It's time to play  
let's vadiar  
  
the roda passes in the middle  
Berimbau I speak like this  
The game ends now  
Capoeira has no end  
  
It's time to play  
let's vadiar  
  
What does Capoeira live for?  
When Berimbau Disarms  
and a sadness in the spirit  
the eyes filling with water  
  
It's time to play  
let's vadiar  
  
i will i will i will vadiar  
  
i will i will i will vadiar  
  
It's time to play  
let's vadiar  
  
It's time to play  
let's vadiar  
  
I will i will i will vadiar  
  
I will i will, i will vadiar |
