## YOU ARE AS OLD AS YOUR SPINE

\- Chinese proverb

## 8 WEEK BRIDGE CHALLENGE

For the next 8 weeks, I will be doing bridges every day as part of my #8weekbridge challenge. The challenge is to do 3 minutes of spinal waves (explained below) and hold a bridge for a total of 7 minutes - which equals 10 minutes of back centered movement DAILY.

## IT HURTS WHEN YOU DO A BRIDGE?

Many people experience pain when they do a bridge, especially in their lower back, and they have no idea why. When the pain doesn't go away they think, "this isn't meant for me", but I can tell you, it's all in the method.

From my experience training and working with Capoeiristas, I have learned that VERY FEW people feel comfortable bending backwards. Most people feel discomfort/pain and in many cases this is because they don't warm up properly or because they bend from their lower (lumbar) spine, when they should be using their middle (thoracic) spine. The lower back hyperflexes when going backwards, meaning that it's bending further than it's supposed to, while the thoracic spine opens up beautifully when doing a bridge, as it's meant to.

## HOW TO WARM UP YOUR SPINE

Doing [spinal waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBOTVWhB-S8) is a great tool to prepare your spine for any back bends. Clicking on the link, you might think, "well, that's the weirdest thing I've seen in a while". The point of doing spinal waves is to move each vertebra in your spine in all directions. This is a great warmup for your back and a tool to teach you how you feel about moving your spine.  

## CAPOEIRA APPLICATION

Spinal have become a morning ritual for me. Despite any soreness or discomfort, spinal waves are an awesome way to bring synovial fluid and blood circulation through your entire back. Try it out, the feeling is amazing when your back is warm and limber. I super recommend this exercise prior to your capoeira workouts and for workouts involving back bends.

for best result:. Do your spinal waves once in the morning and before any workout. The more you move your spine, the more supple it will be when you need it.

Happy bridging. #8weekbridge
