| Sai, sai, Catarina  
Saia do mar  
Venha ver Idalina  
  
**Sai, sai, Catarina**  
  
Saia do mar venha ver, venha ver  
  
**Sai, sai, Catarina**  
  
Oi Catarina, venha ver  
  
**Sai, sai, Catarina**  
  
Sai do mar, venha ver, venha ver  
  
**Sai, sai, Catarina**  
  
Saia do mar, Idalina vem ver  
  
**Sai, sai, Catarina** | Come out, come out, Catarina  
Get out of the sea of the sea  
Come see Idalina  
  
Come out, come out, Catarina  
  
Get out of the sea come see, come see  
  
Come out, come out, Catarina  
  
Hey Catarina, come see  
  
Come out, come out, Catarina  
  
Get out of the sea, come see, come see  
  
Come out, come out, Catarina  
  
Get out of the sea, Idalina come and see  
  
Come out, come out, Catarina |
