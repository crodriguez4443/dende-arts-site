## Ginga: Does Size Matter?

        <td>Something I was thinking of the other day. Does it matter how large your ginga is? Some regional groups have the widest gingas I could have imagined possible, while Angola groups generally ginga with smaller steps. What's the advantage? Disadvantage?</td>

Wide Ginga I think one reason you want a wider ginga is to control more space. More space = more options. Also, if you hold a larger presence in the roda, it's easier to dictate the pacing and temperament of the game. A smaller ginga doesn't do this as well. Smaller Ginga Why a smaller Ginga? I think it has more to do with preparedness. Sometimes you'll find yourself in a smaller space, either because the roda is smaller, or the person you play with is applying pressure in a way that you don't hold much of the roda, and it's good to know how to handle yourself in that scenario. Either way, your ginga is yours and nobody else's. Big or small.
