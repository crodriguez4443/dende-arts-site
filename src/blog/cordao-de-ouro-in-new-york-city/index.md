## TRY, LEARN, REPEAT

## STARTING APRIL 2018

The Capoeira News-o-sphere might not have picked up just yet, but let me be the first to let you know that CDO has come to the Big Apple. As of April 20th, 2018, CDO will have its first official school in New York City. Specifically, it’ll be held at Wild Heart Performing Art Center at 32-32 Steinway St. Floor 3 in Astoria, Queens. Astoria is about 15 minutes outside of Manhattan and the space is accessible to everyone Queens, Manhattan, Harlem, the South Bronx, and most of Brooklyn.

## TAUGHT BY WHO?

Classes will be taught by me, [Monitor Calado](https://www.instagram.com/dende_arts/), student of [Contra-Mestre Cebolinha](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLv5cVrBwdJ/). Classes will be held on Fridays at 7:00pm to 8:30pm. But, if you want up to date information on the [class schedule](http://www.dendearts.com/classes), go to the [website](https://dendearts.com) to see what going on.
