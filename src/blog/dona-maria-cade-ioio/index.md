| Dona Maria cadê ioiô  
Dona Maria cadê iaiá  
  
**Dona Maria cadê ioiô  
Dona Maria cadê iaiá**  
  
A roda tá começando  
Eu não vejo ioiô chegar  
Dona Maria respondeu  
Ela foi fazer o jantar  
  
**Dona Maria cadê ioiô  
Dona Maria cadê iaiá**  
  
Ioiô tá trabalhando  
Iaiá venha pra ca  
Quem não tem cão caça com gato  
A roda vai começar  
  
**Dona Maria cadê ioiô  
Dona Maria cadê iaiá** | Mrs. Maria where's ioiô  
Mrs. Maria where is iaiá  
  
Mrs. Maria where's ioiô  
Mrs. Maria where is iaiá  
  
The roda is starting  
I don't see ioiô coming  
Dona Maria replied  
She went to make dinner  
  
Mrs. Maria where's ioiô  
Mrs. Maria where is iaiá  
  
Ioiô is working  
Iaiá come here  
One who doesn't have a dog, hunts with a cat  
The wheel will start  
  
Mrs. Maria where's ioiô  
Mrs. Maria where is iaiá |

T/L: 'One who doesn't have a dog, hunts with a cat' is an expression in Brazil, meaning if one doesn't have the proper tool for an activity, they must make due with what is available. There are actually two versions of this expression; another is "quem não tem cão caça como gato" (One who doesn't have a dog, hunts like a cat), meaning if you don't have a dog to assist you with your hunt, you need to learn to be sneaky and hunt alone, like a cat.
