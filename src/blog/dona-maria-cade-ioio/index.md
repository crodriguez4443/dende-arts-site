T/L: 'One who doesn't have a dog, hunts with a cat' is an expression in Brazil, meaning if one doesn't have the proper tool for an activity, they must make due with what is available. There are actually two versions of this expression; another is "quem não tem cão caça como gato" (One who doesn't have a dog, hunts like a cat), meaning if you don't have a dog to assist you with your hunt, you need to learn to be sneaky and hunt alone, like a cat.
