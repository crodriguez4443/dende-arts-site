| Olha lá o nego  
**Olha o nego sinhá**  
  
Mas que nego danado  
**Olha o nego sinhá**  
  
Esse nego é valente  
**Olha o nego sinhá**  
  
Mas me pega esse nego  
**Olha o nego sinhá**  
  
Derruba no chão  
**Olha o nego sinhá**  
  
Esse nego é valente  
**Olha o nego sinhá**  
  
Esse nego é o cão  
**Olha o nego sinhá**  
  
Mas castiga esse nego  
**Olha o nego sinhá**  
  
Conforme a razão  
**Olha o nego sinhá**  
  
Ele é capoeira  
**Olha o nego sinhá** | Look there, the black man  
Look at the black man, sinhá  
  
But what a clever black man  
Look at the black man, sinhá  
  
This black man is tough  
Look at the black man, sinhá  
  
But get me this black man  
Look at the black man, sinhá  
  
Knock him to the floor  
Look at the black man, sinhá  
  
This black man is tough  
Look at the black man, sinhá  
  
This black guy is the dog  
Look at the black man, sinhá  
  
But punish this black guy  
Look at the black man, sinhá  
  
Depending on the reason  
Look at the black man, sinhá  
  
He is capoeira  
Look at the black man, sinhá |

Note: To say someone 'is the dog', in Portuguese, is an expression for someone who can be hard to deal with, either because they are aggressive, agitated, or clever. In this case, it's probably referring to the skills of the black man playing capoeira, as in, he plays hard and skilfully, it's difficult to best him.
