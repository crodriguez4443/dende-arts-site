| Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
De Luanda que eu vim  
Com meu Berimbau de Luanda eu vim  
  
**Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
De Luanda que eu vim  
Com meu Berimbau de Luanda eu vim**  
  
Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
Trazendo o Axé dos meus Orixás  
Trouxe a força de Oxossi guerreiro  
E de pai Oxalá  
  
**Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
De Luanda que eu vim  
Com meu Berimbau de Luanda eu vim**  
  
Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
Num barco a vela jogando ao mar  
No porão do navio negreiro cheguei pra trabalhar  
De Luanda  
**  
Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
Foi de Luanda que eu vim  
De Luanda que eu vim  
Com meu Berimbau de Luanda eu vim** | It was from Luanda that I came  
It was from Luanda that I came  
From Luanda I came  
With my Berimbau from Luanda I came  
  
It was from Luanda that I came  
It was from Luanda that I came  
From Luanda I came  
With my Berimbau from Luanda I came  
  
It was from Luanda that I came  
Bringing the Axé of my Orixás  
Brought the strength of Oxossi the warrior  
And father Oxalá  
  
It was from Luanda that I came  
It was from Luanda that I came  
From Luanda I came  
With my Berimbau from Luanda I came  
  
It was from Luanda that I came  
On a sailing boat playing overboard  
In the hold of the slave ship I arrived to work  
From Luanda  
  
It was from Luanda that I came  
It was from Luanda that I came  
From Luanda I came  
With my Berimbau from Luanda I came |
