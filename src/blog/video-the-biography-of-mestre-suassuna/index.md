This summer I got a chance to read the new biography of Mestre Suassuna, written by [M. Boca Rica](http://capoeiracdobarcelona.com/). Here is 1/3 of my summary of this great work.

Mestre Suassuna is one of the biggest living legends in Capoeira today. His style, students, music, and great personality have brought many to him. He is the creator of Cordao de Ouro one of the largest groups around the world, known for their high quality practitioners and super swaggy movement. This biography is my small contribution to being some light to this awesome figure
