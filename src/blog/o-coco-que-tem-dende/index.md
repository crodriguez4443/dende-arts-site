| Na Bahia tem um coco  
Que se chama coco de sinhá  
É precisa de duas quedas  
Pra esse coco se quebrar  
  
É o coco mironga que tem dendê  
É o coco que tem dendê  
**É o coco mironga que tem dendê**  
Tem dendê, tem dendê  
****É o coco mironga que tem dendê****  
  
A capoeira tem dendê colega velha  
****É o coco mironga que tem dendê****  
  
O tem dendê meu camarada  
**É o coco que tem dendê** | In Bahia there is a coconut  
Which is called coconut of sinhá  
It takes two falls  
For this coconut to break  
  
It's the mironga coconut that has palm oil  
It's the coconut that has palm oil  
It's the mironga coconut that has palm oil  
  
There's oil, there's oil  
It's the mironga coconut that has palm oil  
  
Capoeira has palm oil old friend  
It's the mironga coconut that has palm oil  
  
The berimbau has palm oil my friend  
It's the mironga coconut that has palm oil |
