        <td>In general, <strong>Capoeira classes for adults cost anywhere from $80 - $175 per month. For children, cost per month is approximately $60 - $125. The price per class will depend on how often you go to class, your location, and the price set by the owner.</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

When the monthly membership is higher, make sure to go to as many classes as possible to get the most for your money. You might be paying more in total, but per class you might actually be paying the same as the lower priced memberships!

For example:

Going to class twice a week with a monthly membership of $100 is $12.5 per class.

Going to class three times a week with a monthly membership of $150 is also $12.5.

Just like any activity, memberships are not the only cost. There are other things like events, clothing, and equipment to consider.
