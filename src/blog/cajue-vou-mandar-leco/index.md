Capoeira Master, what happened  
In that roda on a moonlit night  
He gave a meia-lua, received a headbutt  
My friend, you can believe it  
Because in that roda, it was beautiful  
I'm certain because I came from there  
From that very blessed land  
It's Bahia that I'm going to talk about  
  
Vou send lecô  
  
Cashew  
  
I'll send loiá

## Song Explanation:

The introduction opens by addressing "Seu Capoeira," a term of respect for a master or esteemed practitioner. The song recounts a roda on a moonlit night, aluding to a mystical or magical scene. In this roda, a practitioner performs a "meia-lua" (half-moon kick) but receives a "cabeçada" (headbutt) in return. This line highlights the amazing moments that often in the roda and make people go "oooh" and "aaaah". Lastly, the singer expresses their pride in being part of the roda and their connection to Bahia, which they describe as a “very blessed land”. This description underscores the deep heritage and spiritual connection practitioners feel to capoeira’s origins.

The refrains "Vou mandar lecô" and "Vou mandar loiá," literally means that I send "leco" and I send "loiá". It's not clear who these poeple are in the song, but they are sent to bring cashews. Why cachews?

**Traditional Use:** In Brazil, cashews are widely consumed and celebrated. Both the cashew nut and the cashew apple (the fruit to which the nut is attached) are used in various culinary traditions. Cashew apples are eaten fresh, juiced, or made into sweets and beverages.  
**Symbolism:** Cashews can symbolize fertility, abundance, and prosperity due to their high yield and economic value. In some Afro-Brazilian traditions, fruits like cashews are also associated with offerings to deities in Candomblé and other syncretic religions.

Additionally, in Portuguese, "caju" refers to the cashew tree and its fruit, which includes both the nut (castanha de caju) and the cashew apple (cajuína). "Cajuê" is not a standard Portuguese word and appears to be a phonetic or poetic variation used in capoeira songs or regional dialects, particularly in Bahia, Brazil. So, while "caju" is the correct and widely recognized term for the cashew tree and its fruit in Portuguese, "cajuê" seems to be a localized or creative variation used in specific cultural expressions, like this song!
