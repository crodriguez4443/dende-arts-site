Que ele e bom até demais<br>
Escorrega na mandinga<br>
Tropeça mas não cai<br><br>
O menino é bom<br>
Bate palmas pra ele<br><br>
Ê, menino é bom<br>
Bate palmas pra ele</td>
        <td>Don't mistreat this boy<br>
Cause he's good, too good even<br>
He slips on the mandinga<br>
He trips, but doesn't fall<br><br>
The boy is good<br>
Clap for him<br><br>
The boy is good<br>
Clap for him</td>
