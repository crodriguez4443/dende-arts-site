| Pega o nego dá no nego  
  
É ruim de pegar  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego**  
  
No meio da mata virgem  
Onde o nego se escondia  
Era o capitão do mato  
Atrás de escravo corria  
Quando a luta ali travava  
No meio da capoeira  
Era aí que o senhorzinho  
Via que não é brincadeira  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego**  
  
É ruim de pegar  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego**  
  
Ninguém vai achar  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego**  
  
Tinha um homem valente  
Que era muito respeitado  
Sobrinho de Ganga Zumba  
No quilombo mais falado  
Que ganhou a liderança  
Para defender povo dali  
No Quilombo dos Palmares  
Era o guerreiro Zumbi  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego**  
  
É ruim de pegar  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego**  
  
Ninguém vai achar  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego**  
  
No tempo do cativeiro era muita covardia  
Nego era caçado dia e noite e noite e dia  
Já cansado de apanhar  
Ele criou a capoeira  
Que era para se libertar  
Fugir de qualquer maneira  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego**  
  
É ruim de pegar  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego**  
  
Ninguém vai achar  
  
**Pega o nego dá no nego** | Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
He's hard to catch  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
In the middle of virgin forest  
Where the black man hid  
It was the captain of the bush  
Who chased after slaves  
When the fight was fought there  
In the middle of the underbrush  
That's when the little sir  
Saw that it was no joke  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
He's hard to catch  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
Nobody will find him  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
There was a brave man  
Who was very respected  
Nephew of Ganga Zumba  
In the most talked about quilombo  
Who won the leadership  
To defend people there  
In the Quilombo dos Palmares  
He was the warrior Zumbi  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
He's hard to catch  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
Nobody will find him  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
In the time of captivity it was a lot of cowardice  
The black man was hunted day and night and night and day  
Already tired of being beaten  
He created capoeira  
So as to break free  
To escape by any means  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
He's hard to catch  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him  
  
Nobody will find him  
  
Catch the black man, give it to him |
