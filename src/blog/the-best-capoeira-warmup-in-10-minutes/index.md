A good warm up should increase your heart rate and get your blood pumping in anticipation for any activity. Next, it should improve circulation in the joints that will be seeing a lot of work. A warm up should also start up your nervous system and get it ready for the intensity you are about to expose it to.

This might run contrary to some people's beliefs that a warm up is supposed to literally "warm up the body". Or that a warm up should consist of stretches to "elongate" muscles. At the same time, warm ups like jumping jacks, running, and mountain climbers are not inherently bad in any way. They just don't cover the wide range of preparation that an activity like Capoeira requires. When you play Capoeira, the body will be moving in many different ways, and this is what we want to get it ready for.

We'll start work with the most critical things to warm up. Our time limit will be 10 minutes and we'll try to get you as ready as possible to play Capoeira in that time. We'll also assume you don't have any prior injuries (because otherwise this guide would be impossible to do).

## Dynamic kicks for legs

It's probably not a surprise that we start with the legs. In Capoeira, there are so many kicks and squat-like movements, that it's impossible to think of a warm up that does not include the legs to some degree. The first warm up we want to focus on is a dynamics stretch for the legs. We do this with straight kicks up in the air, making sure to kick as high as we can.

If you feel like you need to hold on to something while you do your kicks, feel free to hold onto the wall or a chair. As you kick, keep your back straight and tuck in the pelvis. Also make sure your head stays in place. It's very common for people to bend their backs and throw their heads forwards as a way to take pressure off of their hamstrings.

There are three ways we want to kick and I recommend 12-15 kicks with each leg in each direction. The first is a kick in front of you with a straight leg. Kick up as high as you can without compromising your posture. You can kick your hand as a reference. Second, is a crescent kick. The leg will move from the outside towards the inside. If you find this difficult, remember that it's better to kick lower, than to compromise your posture. The last kick we'll do is a reverse crescent kick. This kick starts from the inside, moves up, and then goes out. The idea is to kick as high as you can and fire up the quad muscles that govern your ability to kick high.
