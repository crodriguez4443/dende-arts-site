Capoeira is an afro-brazilian martial art with a massive list of movements. There are many strikes, defenses, take downs, and acrobatics that make it very different from any other form of self defense. Here is a list of the most fundamental Capoeira movements that any beginner will want to learn. This guide provides a small description of what each movement is called with translation, how to perform the movement, and why the movement is performed. If you're interested in the art, then this is the definitive list of the most fundamental Capoeira movements you should learn. Future lists will be created to encompass as many movements as possible, so look forward to those!

        <td><strong>Ginga</strong>: Pronuncia-se "Jinga"<br><br>
        <em>Ginga</em> em português significa balançar. A ginga difere muito entre grupos e praticantes, da mesma forma que um sotaque muda dependendo da região. A ginga mais amplamente utilizada é realizada ficando em uma posição de avanço com o braço oposto levantado para proteger o queixo. A outra mão fica pronta, ao lado do corpo. Os capoeiristas então movem a perna de trás lateralmente em paralelo com os quadris. A outra perna então recua para avançar do outro lado. Isso essencialmente espelha a primeira posição com a perna oposta para trás e o antebraço oposto para cima protegendo o queixo.</td>

        <em>Ginga</em> in Portuguese means to swing. The ginga differs greatly between groups and practitioners, the same way an accent changes depending on what region you are in. The most widely used ginga is performed by standing in a lunged position with the opposite arm raised to protect the chin. The other hand stays at the ready, by the side of the body. The capoeiristas then moves the back leg laterally in parallel with the hips. The other leg then steps back to lunge on the other side. This essentially mirrors the first position with the opposite leg back and opposite forearm up protecting the chin.</td>

The ginga is the base of almost all Capoeira techniques and is used to set up kicks, sweep, dodges, take downs, and other movements. The ginga is also a marker of someone's skill, with many experienced Capoeiristas being able to gauge the strength or ability of other capoeirista based on their ginga.   

The rhythmic back and forth of this movement is one of the reasons people see Capoeira as a choreography or a dance. Although the origins of the ginga is not known, during the time when Capoeira was deemed illegal, it was used to fool authorities into believing a group of people were enjoying a dance in the streets, rather than settling a dispute with Capoeira. Capoeira was illegal in Brazil from the late 1800's to the early 1900's, with severe punishment to those seen practicing the art.
