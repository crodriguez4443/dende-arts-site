## Dear those with doubts...

This post is coming off the heels of [Red Bull Paranauê](https://dendearts.com/summary-red-bull-paranaue-2018/), a Capoeira competition held in Salvador, Bahia, a place many people feel is the holy grounds of Capoeira. Check the link to see a summary of the event.

If you're like most people, when you see Capoeira, you think, "Oh crap that was pretty insane…". But like many people, the thought of actually doing Capoeira starts up a whole host of doubts and questions. Can I do this? Am I in good enough shape?

## NO PREREQUISITES

Don't worry about being too fat, too tall, too small, too this or that, I've heard it all and seen it all. People 6' 4" and up playing Capoeira, People severely overweight playing Capoeira, etc. Capoeira has no prerequisites, and like anything else, your body learns as it goes along. There are people who play into their 80's and and as young as 2.  If an old man of 84 can do it, someone half that age can as well. Don't let self doubt stop you from trying something you admire.

## WHAT DO YOU WANT OUT OF CAPOEIRA?

Defining what you personally want out of Capoeira is super important and can differ greatly person to person. There is no "proper" reason for doing Capoeira. Everyone's motivations are slightly different, and often times the motivation you come in with changes over time, so don't be afraid to leap at something you enjoy!

## FIND A TEACHER

Finding a teacher that vibes with you can be difficult if you live in a small city. Capoeira is still not as big as other arts like Yoga, Karate, Taekwondo, etc. and finding a teacher you like can sometimes feel like an adventure all its own. But if you are lucky enough to have someone who teaches Capoeira in your area, check out their classes and see if their style of Capoeira and teaching works for you. Some styles focus on the martial arts aspet (typically regional), others focus on the tradition (Angola), and others have a mix of the two (Contemporanea). Check out a couple schools and ask around to what you like best.
