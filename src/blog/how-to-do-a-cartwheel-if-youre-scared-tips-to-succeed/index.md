I apologize, but there are no song lyrics in Portuguese and English in this markdown document. This appears to be a blog post about how to do cartwheels. The formatting specifications you provided are for a song lyrics table, but this document does not contain such content. 

Would you like me to help you with formatting this blog post in some other way, or did you intend to send a different document with song lyrics?
