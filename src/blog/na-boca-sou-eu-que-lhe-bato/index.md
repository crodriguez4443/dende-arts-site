| Na Bahia , na Bahia  
é na Bahia, na Bahia  
Não temos um doutor  
Robar a jóia do governador  
Sou eu cantador de harmonia,  
eu conheço a força do gado  
E o gado é que manda a lei  
a lei é que manda o gado  
Eu sambei com Maria Preta,  
no ano de 24  
E o resultado que eu tive  
eu perdi o pé meu de sapato  
  
Você vem pra me bater  
Coro  
**Na boca sou eu quem lhe bato  
**  
Você pensa me bater  
**Na boca sou eu quem lhe bato  
**  
Mas você pensa me bater  
**Na boca sou eu quem lhe bato** | In Bahia, in Bahia  
It's in Bahia, in Bahia  
we have no doctor  
Stealing the governor's jewel  
I am a singer of harmony,  
I know the power of cattle  
And it is the cattle that dictate the law  
The law is what commands the cattle  
I danced samba with Maria Preta,  
in the year of '24  
And the result that I had  
I lost the sole of my shoe  
  
You come to hit me  
Chorus  
**It is I who will hit you in the mouth  
**  
You think you're going to hit me  
**It is I who will hit you in the mouth  
**  
But you think you're going to hit me  
**It is I who will hit you in the mouth** |

## Explanation and Significance

Bahia is often considered the heart of Afro-Brazilian culture in Brazil, with strong ties to African traditions. The song mentions Bahia twice in its opening lines to emphasize the significance of the location.

The reference to a "doctor stealing the governor's jewel" is difficult to interpret and might symbolize resistance against authority or the reclaiming of wealth and power by those oppressed or marginalized. It's a figurative expression that could allude to outsmarting or challenging the establishment in a context where direct confrontation was not possible.

The mention of "cattle" and the law could refer to the social and economic structures of power and control, possibly critiquing or reflecting on the dynamics of power in society. Cattle are significant in many African traditions and could symbolize wealth, status, or social order.

"Danced samba with Maria Preta in the year of '24" could be referencing a specific event or a symbolic moment. "Maria Preta" (Black Maria) could be a fictional character representing African-Brazilian women, symbolizing strength, resilience, and the Afro-Brazilian cultural identity, but it's not entirely clear. The loss of the shoe's sole might symbolize the hardships or sacrifices experienced during these moments of cultural expression and resistance.

The chorus, "It is I who will hit you in the mouth," repeated throughout, suggests a defiance and readiness to confront aggression or opposition, possibly reflecting a broader theme of resistance against oppression. It can also signal to the person playing you that although they want to "hit you", that in fact, they will be on the receiving end of a hit to the mouth. It's a brash and defiant statement that will hopefully be reflected in the games being played.
