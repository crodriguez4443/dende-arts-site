Author: Unknown (Do you know who wrote this song? Tell us in the comments!)  
Note 1: There are some variations. Sometimes the chorus also sings "Lemba do barro vermelho."  
Note 2: I am not entirely sure what Lemba is in the case of this song. The Lemba are a Bantu ethnic group native to Zimbabwe and South Africa, though I have also seen references of Lemba as a Nkisi, a bantu deity similar to orixás.
