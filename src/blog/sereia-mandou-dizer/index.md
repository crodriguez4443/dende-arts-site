| Sereia mandou dizer  
Sereia mandou falar  
Que no mar tem muita areia  
Tem muita areia no mar  
  
**Tem, tem, tem areia  
Tem, tem, tem areia do mar**  
  
Tem, tem, tem areia  
Tem, tem, tem areia do mar  
  
**Tem, tem, tem areia  
Tem, tem, tem areia do mar** | Mermaid ordered to tell  
Mermaid told to say  
That there is a lot of sand in the sea  
There is a lot of sand in the sea  
  
There is, there is, there is sand  
There is, there is, there is sea sand  
  
There is, there is, there is sand  
There is, there is, there is sea sand  
  
There is, there is, there is sand  
There is, there is, there is sea sand |
