| Entrada opcional por DJ Capoeira:  
  
No tempo que a capoeira  
Era um jogo pesado,  
Menino que entrava em roda  
Saia de braço quebrado.  
Ê, dava nele uma rasteira  
Coice de mula e uma queixada,  
Rabo de arraia e uma benção pulada  
Jogava ele na calçada  
Menino que entrava em roda  
E não sabia dá pernada.”  
  
Abalou cachoeira abalou  
E abalou deixa abalar  
  
**Abalou cachoeira abalou  
**  
E abalou vem abalar  
  
**Abalou cachoeira abalou  
**  
E abalou vai abalar  
  
**Abalou cachoeira abalou  
**  
Menino bom deixa jogar  
  
**Abalou cachoeira abalou  
**  
Abalou deixa abalar | Optional Intro by DJ Capoeira  
  
In the time that capoeira  
It was a rough game  
Boy enters the roda  
Leaves with a broken arm.  
Ê, They gave him a rasteira  
Mule kick and a Queixada,  
Rabo de arraia and a jumping Benção  
Played him on the pavement  
Boy walking around  
And I didn’t know about pernada\*  
  
Shook, cachoeira shook  
It shook, let it shake  
  
shook cachoeira shook  
  
It shook, come shake  
  
shook cachoeira shook  
  
It shook, it will shake  
  
shook cachoeira shook  
  
Good boy let him play  
  
shook cachoeira shook  
  
it shook, let it shake |

## Explanation:

As the story goes, "Cachoeira" refers to a neighborhood in Salvador where there were regular rodas. The rodas were so good in Cachoeira that the whole neighborhood would "abala" or shake. Saying Abalou Cacheoeira Abalou", is a retelling of the story of these rodas and reminding people how good they were, and how significant they were in this neighborhood. The song calls for the same kind of strong energy that could bring down the building. The pre-able by DJ Capoeira recounts the violent history of capoeira, especially in times when it was more closely associated with rough neighborhoods and tough guys that would test each other in the roda.

The entrance to the song describes a time when entering the "roda" (circle) could result in physical injury, emphasizing the violent nature of the game. The mention of a boy who enters the roda and the physical moves used (like "rasteira" which is a sweeping move, "coice de mula" or mule kick, and "queixada" or jaw strike) highlight the danger for someone who enters the roda unaware of the danger. The preamble does a good job at presenting the roda as something to be cautious about.
