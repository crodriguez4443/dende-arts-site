        <td>Responses to attacks in capoeira rely heavily on Dodge's rather than blocks. Although there are some blocks in the capoeira repertoire, it is much more common to see a Dodge than a block. One of the main reasons for this is the number of kicks to punches being thrown. In capoeira there are way more kicks than there are punches and generally you do not want to block a kick with your hands. Instead of capoeira practitioner will choose to dodge kick and respond with a strike of their own. The majority of the Dodges in capoeira focus on moving below a Kick, however there are others that move inwards, laterally, and away.</td>
