The provided markdown document does not contain song lyrics in Portuguese and English, so I cannot format it into a table as specified. This document appears to be a blog post about Capoeira kids' classes and a free introductory class. 

Would you like me to help you with something else related to this document, or do you have a different markdown file with song lyrics that needs formatting?
