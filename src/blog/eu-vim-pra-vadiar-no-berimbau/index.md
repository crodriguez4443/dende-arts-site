| Eu vim pra vadiar no berimbau  
Eu vim pra vadiar no jogo  
Eu vim pra vadiar no canto e na palma  
Eu vim ver capoeira vadiar  
  
**Eu vim pra vadiar no berimbau  
Eu vim pra vadiar no jogo  
Eu vim pra vadiar no canto e na palma  
Eu vim ver capoeira vadiar**  
  
Vadeia berimbau me dá o som  
Transmita toda sua energia  
Ao seu comando a roda vai começar  
Pois hoje é dia de alegria  
  
**Eu vim pra vadiar no berimbau  
Eu vim pra vadiar no jogo  
Eu vim pra vadiar no canto e na palma  
Eu vim ver capoeira vadiar**  
  
E o capoeira sai para a vadiação  
E um bom jogo nos arrepia  
Martelo, cabeçada, rasteira e pisão  
Mas sem atropelo e na harmonia  
  
**Eu vim pra vadiar no berimbau  
Eu vim pra vadiar no jogo  
Eu vim pra vadiar no canto e na palma  
Eu vim ver capoeira vadiar**  
  
E o canto embala o coração  
É história é lamento é poesia  
E a voz de um guerreiro solta no ar  
E a palma animando a bateria  
**  
Eu vim pra vadiar no berimbau  
Eu vim pra vadiar no jogo  
Eu vim pra vadiar no canto e na palma  
Eu vim ver capoeira vadiar** | I came to play the berimbau  
I came to have fun in the game  
I came to have a good time, singing and clapping  
I came to see capoeira play  
  
I came to play the berimbau  
I came to have fun in the game  
I came to have a good time, singing and clapping  
I came to see capoeira play  
  
Play berimbau, give me the sound  
Transmit all your energy  
At your command the roda will start  
For today is a day of joy  
  
I came to play the berimbau  
I came to have fun in the game  
I came to have a good time, singing and clapping  
I came to see capoeira play  
  
And the capoeira goes out to play  
And a good game gives us goosebumps  
Martelo, cabeçada, rasteira, and pisão  
But no trampling and in harmony  
  
I came to play the berimbau  
I came to have fun in the game  
I came to have a good time, singing and clapping  
I came to see capoeira play  
  
And the song cradles the heart  
It's history, it's a lament, it's poetry  
And a warrior's voice loose in the air  
And the palm animating the drums  
  
I came to play the berimbau  
I came to have fun in the game  
I came to have a good time, singing and clapping  
I came to see capoeira play |

T/L: Not 'trampling' here is supposed to mean something like not going overboard in the game, playing respectively and cooperatively with ones partner.
