| Jangadeiro tá longe do barco  
Marinheiro tá longe do mar  
Sinto falta do meu berimbau  
Sem capoeira não posso ficar  
**  
Jangadeiro tá longe do barco  
Marinheiro tá longe do mar  
Sinto falta do meu berimbau  
Sem capoeira não posso ficar**  
  
O jangadeiro  
**Tá longe do barco**  
  
O marinheiro  
**Tá longe do mar**  
  
O jangadeiro  
**Tá longe do barco**  
  
O marinheiro  
**Tá longe do mar** | The fisherman is far from the boat  
The sailor is far from the sea  
I miss my berimbau  
Without capoeira I can't stay  
  
The fisherman is far from the boat  
The sailor is far from the sea  
I miss my berimbau  
Without capoeira I can't stay  
  
The fisherman  
Is far from the boat  
  
The sailor  
Is far from the sea  
  
The fisherman  
Is far from the boat  
  
The sailor  
Is far from the sea |
