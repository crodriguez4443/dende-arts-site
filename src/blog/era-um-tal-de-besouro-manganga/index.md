| Certo dia numa festa  
Um menino me chamou pra jogar  
Eu que sou desconfiado  
Fiquei logo de lado à reparar  
O que estava escrito na camisa  
  
**Era um tal de Besouro Mangangá**  
  
O que estava escrito na camisa  
  
**Era um tal de Besouro Mangangá**  
  
Ê ê, ê a  
  
**Era um tal de Besouro Mangangá**  
  
Perna para cima, deixa o nego vadiar  
**  
Era um tal de Besouro Mangangá** | One day at a party  
A boy called me to play  
I am a way person  
I immediately stood by to pay attention  
What was written on the shirt  
  
It was this so-called Besouro Mangangá  
  
What was written on the shirt  
  
It was this so-called Besouro Mangangá  
  
Ê ê, ê a  
  
It was this so-called Besouro Mangangá  
  
Leg up, let the nigga loiter  
  
It was this so-called Besouro Mangangá |
