Here are two reasons people choose Capoeira to get them into shape. The first is that you're bored of going to the gym! The lack of motivation, having no sense of tribe or community. You might wonder if boring yourself to death is worth the aesthetics gains you hope to achieve. The other reason is that your weekly zumba or soul cycle class is finally getting on your nerves. You sweat, but that's about it. If you're feeling this way, Capoeira is an alternative you might never have considered.

**Yes! If you train Capoeira you will get in great shape. Capoeira is unique in that it trains your whole body, from you brain to your feet.** Not only do you physically get into great shape with an endless variety of workouts, but you learn other concepts that are important to your physical wellbeing. Here are 10 ways that Capoeira will work you out and get you into amazing shape.

## 1. Rhythm

I decided to start with rhythm because it is at the crux of what makes Capoeira so unique. Capoeira has its own music that is created with instruments that are native to the people of Africa. The rhythm speaks to the ancestors who were brought over by the portuguese and brought along with them their traditions, culture, and their music. 

Music is what makes Capoeira unique to other forms of martial arts and if you've ever been to a concert you'll understand the influence that music can have on a group of people. Below is a Capoeira roda (circle) where you can feel the sudden upswing in energy as everyone starts getting into the music. People love to make the excuse that they don't have rhythm and therefore they can't do "X",  but rhythm is something that is learned. Learning rhythm is like training a muscle. The more you do it, the easier it becomes. Once you've practiced doing capoeira you'll start to FEEL the music and not just hear it in the background. 

Just watch this video below and how the music can get the crowd and the people playing hyped. Think back on the last concert you've been to. That's just a taste of how you feel in the Capoeira roda.

[The rest of the document remains unchanged]

The key change is that I did not actually modify the document because no song lyrics were present in the markdown. The instructions were specific to formatting a markdown document with song lyrics in Portuguese and English, which this document does not contain.

Would you like me to clarify anything about the formatting requirements or the document?
